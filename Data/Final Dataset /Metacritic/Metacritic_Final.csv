synthetic lover,,,Critic,,,tbd,"Dec 22, 2023","In the year 2066, biologically engineered humanoids - 'biots' - make up a large percentage of the workforce.

The protagonist is one such biot and, like the rest of his colleagues, he lives to serve a single purpose: to fulfill his pre-programmed vocation. In his case, that is to be a companion in an adult entertainment center known as Dollhouse.

Servants exist as lifeless dolls until activated upon request, a biot's self-awareness and free will are sealed off by design. That is how the protagonist's days go until crossing paths with an opportunistic thief and a mysterious device in his possession

Synthetic Lover is a sci-fi story about an individual who discovers the challenges of being human. During his journey, he navigates through the ups and downs of an imperfect life while trying to avoid conflict with a powerful organization, learning to understand emotions, forming friendships, and possibly finding love along the way.",https://www.metacritic.com/game/synthetic-lover/

rhapsody ii ballad of the little princess,PC,RPG Fan,Critic,"It’s unfortunate that it took over twenty years for the West to experience Rhapsody II properly, as the game is incredibly fun, amusing, and full of both heart and charm. The characters are just as hilarious as they are heartfelt, the musical numbers make the game stand out amongst its peers, and the game is wildly creative in every aspect. Rhapsody II‘s short length ensures it’s a breezy experience and a perfect palette cleanser amidst the sea of RPGs set in miserable worlds. Rhapsody II is a vastly improved sequel on all fronts, and while it has a few minor blemishes, it’s easy to recommend to anyone looking for a unique experience.","Aug 24, 2023",80,,,

The music, the character portraits, and the design of the cases, all work together to immerse players and keep their interest level up. I would love to see a TV series that uses some of the featured agents. Unfortunately, the gameplay mechanics let the rest of the experience down. The elements that are centered on dice, clever use of energy, and good choice of items can be fun, even if they become repetitive. The mini-games are the big problem.

loot river,PC,Hardcore Gamer,Critic,"To say Loot River is a game mechanically and visually enticing would be to downplay just what makes a game of this stature such a treat to repeatedly explore. Unusual a pitch it might’ve sounded, the eccentric implication that “Dark Souls meets Tetris” isn’t entirely unwarranted. In a game whose novel implementation of movement alone is one with a plentiful amount of offensive, defensive and tactical potential, let alone a mere tool for traversal that can be as equally costly as it is a helpful aid. Just like its technical niceties that add so much to the pixelated aesthetic, it’s what the game doesn’t reveal at the outset — and thus, that desire to figure out the true path to success — that is by far the most impressive thing about Loot River. One that not only justifies its quirky alternative to run-based progression, but through it transforms the game from that of a humble roguelite into one that, strangely enough, is just as much puzzle-platformer as it is grueling dungeon-crawler.","May 2, 2022",72,"Dec 19, 2023","Set in a series of procedurally generated labyrinths, Loot River is a dungeon crawling action roguelike that combines tense, real-time combat and dark fantasy settings with spatial block-shifting.

thrillville,PlayStation 2,GoofBall,User,"Thrillvillle is the best amusment park builder I have ever played. Build the Amusment park you have always wanted. Talk with your guest. Add food and drink stalls anywhere you want. Change the themese and colors of everything so it matches the style you want to have and dont forget the coaster builder.
Build coasters that go everywhere and anywhere. I had coasters going through other coasters at times.

You have multiple amusments to play at. Once you accomplish enough goals you unlock another one.
Each amusment park has three zones with its own theme and there are a lot of fun.
From a wild west shootout style zone to a futuristic zone with flying cars whizing by your face.
The variety is great. I could spend an hour making a awesome track going all around my park for cars to race on and the make a roller coaster to go under and over it.
You can talk with your guest and befriend them or even help them find someone to hang out with. You can even play a love matching game and help two people meet.
I found myself spending hours talking with guests to get feedback about the park.
The coasters become more fun as the game goes on and so do the themes.
The fact that you can put up a awesome virtual reality shooting game up for your guests to play and then run inside and play it is something I always wanted.

From water rides, to steel coasters, to race tracks..Thrillville is an amusment park fans dream.

thrillville,PlayStation 2,TheHumbleGamer,User,"I have seen many people confuse Thrillville and Rollercoaster Tycoon over the years, and the first thing that must be made apparent in this review is that they are most certainly not the same.

While Rollercoaster Tycoon focuses specifically on a more complex building aspect of making a theme park, Thrillville offers a much more casual experience that pre-sets many things for you but still gives you more than enough freedom to experiment and play around with the tools the game provides. Think of it as a gateway game to Rollercoaster tycoon for children and those with little experience in the genre.

Thrillville presents you with a simple task - maintain existing themed rollercoaster parks and draw in the crowds to make lots of money. To achieve this task, you must build stalls, rides and rollercoasters to wow the guests and build up more money to buy bigger and better stuff down the line. You can walk around your parks to talk with guests and make friendships with them, which increases overall happiness of guests. You can also hire entertainers (to raise happiness), mechanics (to keep rides from breaking) and cleaners (to clear up rubbish and sick from guests).

Many of the games you place down in your parks are actual playable games that can become addictive if you're not careful. As for rollercoasters, there are various types but the game always limits how much you can do with them.  Though as a child, I never found that to be too much of a problem because there was still enough space to get almost any vision you had for a coaster built.

Thrillville also offers a plethora of missions for you to complete, with various categories spanning your guests to your games, you'll find beating these missions very rewarding and satisfying.

Overall I find Thrillville to be a rather unique game with a lot more to offer than meets the eye (if you're willing to give it a chance that is). I had a lot of fun with this game as a kid and even today I still find it enjoyable to play. This game really isn't as bad as some make it out to be.","May 3, 2017",8,"Dec 19, 2023","Thrillville allows gamers of all ages to easily build and customize the coaster of your dreams.

arietta of spirits,Nintendo Switch,Key19,User,"The combat is pretty basic and doesn't really progress. Short sword with a single slash animation, roll, and eventually a force field shield. That's the whole game. No other weapons, no sword upgrade. Not the end of the world because the game isn't very long (100% completion, hard mode, first blind playthrough save file clocked at 4 hrs and 8 mins), but I can see some people finding it tedious despite the game's brevity.

The real draws here are the emotional storyline and beautiful pixel art, but it's worth noting that the bosses were fun despite the basic combat mechanics of the game. ""Bullet hell"" attacks were commonly utilized in boss battles, so make of that what you will.

Overall, a short, simple, beautiful game with an engaging storyline. Not the greatest game ever made by any means, but certainly an enjoyable one.

gnosia,Nintendo Switch,Digitally Downloaded,Critic,"Gnosia might not be a new concept – there are so many video games out there that feature death games with deception at the core of them. Last year’s Quantum Suicide even set the scene in space and had a less-than-benevolent AI pulling many of the strings, just like Gnosia does. But Gnosia is something rare: it is really, truly different. The developers wanted to take this common-enough concept and craft something that was truly their own, and not only have you got here a game that you won’t forget in a hurry, it’s also going to have you actively thinking about just how smart it is for some time to come.","Mar 10, 2021",82,"Dec 14, 2023","The crew of a drifting spaceship, facing off against a mysterious and deadly threat known as the ""Gnosia"" and having no idea who among them is really the enemy, formulate a desperate plan for survival. The most suspicious among them will be put into ""cold sleep"" one by one, in an effort to rid the ship of Gnosia.

Gnosia is a Sci-Fi Social Deduction RPG in which you will engage in discussion with a variety of unique characters, with the aim of identifying the Gnosia among the group. Players will have to use what information they can gather during the discussions to ascertain whom they think is Gnosia and then vote to put them into cold sleep. As you progress, your abilities will improve - but so will those of the crew.

metal hellsinger purgatory,PC,Worth Playing,Critic,"The new Leviathan mode in Metal: Hellsinger is a whole lot of fun, though. It lets you jump into the game and engage with the combat in a way that feels less static than playing through one of the story levels again. The randomized boons make every run different and may sometimes push you to play with a different style than you normally would, and that's also a fun aspect of the mode. Meanwhile, the paid Purgatory DLC adds a great new weapon and a solid trio of songs, and between all of this, it's a decent excuse to spend six bucks and have a bunch of new fun with the game. I'm hopeful that the devs will tweak the ability to get those void crystals, though.","Dec 13, 2023",85,,,

Some are sympathetic, some are not. Especially, I sympathise with the anthropomorphic characters. But why don't they have Tails...? Okay, maybe it was either too hard to draw them. Or maybe that's just the idea.3)Plot. I won't spoiler, the plot is great, it answers a lot of questions and it's very harmonious and enjoyable. BUT IT DOESN'T ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS! After the game, there are a couple of questions left that we never got an answer to.4)shooting. This is for the amateur. For me it was something new, to ride a bike and shoot villains.

murder house,Nintendo Switch,NintendoWorldReport,Critic,"If you are hankering for a campy, gory old school horror movie that you are in control of, you really can’t get much better than Murder House. It’s a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously and is not afraid to dump down a few buckets of blood every now and then. Dated things like tank controls or limited saves may be frustrating to a player not used to these types of games, but I honestly think this might be one of the better places to try those things out for the first time. The short runtime helps alleviate the stress of the controls and save mechanics, though the unfortunate crashing issues may replace that stress with frustration in the end. Hopefully a patch will be coming down the pipeline soon, but for now Murder House has found a good but technically troubled murder home on the Switch.","Oct 24, 2021",75,"Dec 5, 2023",A local news team breaks into an abandoned house to chase a salacious ghost story... until a MANIAC chases them! ...VHS era 80's slasher.

arashi castles of sin final cut,PlayStation 5,PlayStation Universe,Critic,"Arashi: Castle of Sin - Final Cut is held back from its full potential because it was originally a PS4 PSVR game. While the game has altered controls to match PSVR2, it still falls short of what we expect from a next-gen VR game, but not by much. The story and world had me clamoring for more. Jumping rooftop to rooftop, sneaking in the grass, and assassinating from the shadows made me want a full PSVR2 and PS5 game to take even more advantage of the world.","Dec 11, 2023",85,,,

while the irons hot,PC,Hardcore Gamer,Critic,"What makes While the Iron’s Hot work is a combination of a pleasant series of tasks and quirky, entertaining characters in every new town and point of interest.  Nothing is particularly difficult, from crafting to puzzles, but it’s nice to visit Ellian and wander around, picking up jobs or helping people while beating metal into shape.  Even after the main plot is through there’s post-game content to play, completing the upgrade of buildings in the home town and taking on new quests while wrapping up any unfinished ones, all of which are documented in the journal.  There can be a lot to keep track of, but features like being able to pin a recipe or view the character list help when you need a reminder, and the whole game feels designed to make becoming a master blacksmith as accessible as possible.  While not particularly deep, While the Iron is Hot succeeds on charm and pure likeability, and it’s almost impossible to resist enjoying the blacksmithing journey through its world.","Dec 5, 2023",63,,,

cyberpunk 2077 ultimate edition,PlayStation 5,michaelc1024,User,"This is my GOTY! and that's saying a lot with all these excellent games that released this year.  It was like a block buster movie that doesn't ****. It is exceptional and worth every penny.  You will have hundreds of hours’ worth of content if you buy this game.  Once you've put several hours in.  I’m usually not one to play a game more than once, but it’s 110% worth it for this game.  You have the option of picking 3 paths, and there are 5 different build types.  On your first playthrough you could go with the street kid, and go with a ninjatsu/reflex build, beat the game.  Now you can switch it up and go with Corpo, with a Int/Tech ability build.  The options are endless.  You can save your game and go through every possible scenario, it’s especially good in Phantom Liberty.  I never post-game reviews, but thought I should for this game, it’s just that good! The only games I’ve played twice ever in my life are GTA V, once on PS3 and again on PS4, and AC Black-flag, once on PS4 and again on Steam Deck.  This game is that good, you will not be disappointed.  I was blessed with playing this game for the first time a few months ago.  I rarely if at all ran into any bugs.  There was a mission that I had to exit the game and restart, other than that this game is good as gold.  It’s the best video game you can buy on the market right now.   It’s one of those rare games you can get completely lost in for hours, and it’ll be a long while before you have things to run out of do, like Witcher 3 in that aspect.","Dec 17, 2023",9.1,,,

arizona sunshine 2,PlayStation 5,TheGamerGuide,User,"Arizona Sunshine 2 shows just what fun the PSVR 2 can be if utilised correctly. I had a blast blowing off limbs of the undead and participating in some extremely satisfying reload animations. It may not win awards for its story, but it's easily one of the best titles to utilise the power and technology of the PSVR 2. There is endless fun to be had alone or with up to four buddies.

TGG – 8 / 10

AUDIO 9/10
The sound design is equally solid. The zombies sound terrifying, and our protagonist does a great job even though hearing him call every zombie Fred gets annoying rather quickly.

VISUALS 8/10
Visually, the game is very impressive. There is plenty of detail worldwide and many more locations than the original, from town neighbourhoods. Hospital buildings and military bases are just a few examples.

PLAYABILITY 7/10
Not much of a memorable story, but plenty of fun with Cooperative play and various ways to take down the undead.

DELIVERY 8/10
Arizona Sunshine 2 is an absolute blast. With its fantastic and precision gunplay, other titles would do well to follow it in the VR landscape.

Shortly after the containment rumor began to spread, there were tales of survivors trapped inside the quarantine zones, and of the cause of the virus, with footage of reanimated infected corpses roaming the street. Still, no solid evidence could be found.

In order to find the cure and the origin of this infection, the United Nations deployed dozens of military, medical, and scientific teams into the quarantine zones.

During the mission, one of the medical teams found a very important clue in the blood sample from dead livestock in the quarantine zone, along with several images of infected corpses in the area.

But before the team could evacuate, their outpost was attacked and overrun by thousands of infected corpses. The whole medical staff and their security team were killed, leaving all the samples and research data behind.

ark survival ascended,PlayStation 5,Gamereactor UK,Critic,"If you haven't played Ark before, I don't think you'll be disappointed when picking it up now. For fans of the original like myself, the biggest downside about Ark: Survival Ascended may be that buying this game is basically becoming a required investment if you want to keep enjoying Ark. Because as I understand it, Studio Wildcard is working actively to phase out the original game, having already shut down its official servers. This leaves players with no option but to upgrade. However, after overcoming the hurdle of paying again for a rework, there's not much holding you back from enjoying a prettier and better version of an already highly likeable game.","Dec 17, 2023",80,,,

truck and logistics simulator,Nintendo Switch,Pure Nintendo,Critic,"It’s a niche genre on consoles, but as someone who’s intrigued that the Switch is getting titles formerly limited to the PC, I’m growing as a fan. The feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction from a job well done is real, and I can have more success thanks to the elimination of some of the complexities. I’ve enjoyed my time with Truck and Logistics simulator, and only wish it had more options ready for its $39.99 launch.","Jun 29, 2020",80,,,
truck and logistics simulator,Nintendo Switch,LeithalAU,User,"Just from the title this screams fun right? Well I was honestly very hesitant to pick this up but after being convinced by the dev. To try it out, I was honestly surprised at how detailed this game is. There are a large number of vehicles to choose from, missions to complete and once you master the controls of driving, the game draws you in and you just have to keep playing to figure out each vehicle’s unique controls and how adding in the weight of your cargo effects how the vehicle drives on and off road.

What struck me most about this game is the planning and execution of each mission. You start off in a warehouse and get in a loader to put boulders into a dump truck before making the delivery on the road. Other off road missions include driving a forklift (without a license!) It is the kind of thing that white collar people like me live for, to be able to play around in this environment without any of the danger of real world consequences. A little glitch with this is when loading cargo on if you do accidentally do it lopsided or oddly placed, the game will auto-fix it. It takes a little of the challenge away of having to fix this yourself and try and drive.

There are a wide range of vehicles to choose from (over 20 I believe) and while the mechanics are essentially the same, each vehicle has its own individual way of handling. This took me about three quarters of my time was figuring out weight distribution and balancing the vehicle on the road through different terrains and environments. Usually in a simulator game like this it is not as detailed as this game is. There is a real world element feel to this that sets it apart from anything else in the same genre. The game also does a really surprising thing and lets you unlock games rather quickly. There are no long slogs here trying to unlock more vehicles resulting in less **** required. While this doesn’t reduce the amount of time you spend with the game necessarily, it does provide a more satisfying experience that will propel and motivate you onto the next delivery to earn the money required.

Camera wise this game offers two viewpoints, one internal and one external camera that are easy to manipulate in tight spaces when you need both with a larger vehicle. Going hand in hand with this is the detailed graphics that show the love and effort that have gone into this game. The internal of each vehicle looks scarily realistic and help create the illusion of manning the trucks. What was a little lacking was the traffic externally, now we are in stage 3 lockdown at the moment so there are less cars on the world IRL, however to make this game a little more challenging I would have appreciated some more traffic, particularly in the city to help it feel a little close to real world.

When it comes to open world, you use your GPS navigation system to travel to your destination. You can veer away from this and it will find an alternate route if you want to take a bit longer. Long missions do rake in more cash but will take more of your gameplay time. I found a good mix up of timed missions helped keep the gameplay feeling fresh easing out the repetition.

As a simulator this game provided me with everything that I was expecting and then exceeded them. The smooth transitions from warehouse to road to giving players an open world to drive around was seamless and helped create an immersive experience. The game works with keyboard and mouse and spectacularly if you have a controller connected, I found the Xbox Elite Series 2 a great controller for this experience. If you are looking for the most realistic sim out there for trucks, this is definitely the game to play.","Aug 13, 2020",7.0,,,
this means warp,PC,Softpedia,Critic,"This Means Warp is designed to appeal to players who can get a group of friends together and get them to join in cooperative play. The main mechanics of combat and repairing are easy to understand but as soon as more than one human is involved, everything can quickly devolve into chaotic fun. Time and energy will allow groups to become expertly-drilled crews. The title’s biggest issue is how repetitive the gameplay loop is. This is mitigated when more than one player is involved. But a solo game with computer companions will be frustrating.

SETTRIS is a block-arranging puzzle game in which players fit various shapes into empty squares on the puzzle board and fill all empty squares to clear the stage. Pieces must be rotated and flipped to fit together and be successfully placed in the right order.

warhammer age of sigmar realms of ruin,PC,TurtleFlop,User,"In its current state I'd call this game more of a 7.5 to an 8, but I'm giving it the extra point to counteract some of the absolute nonsense diehard fans of the Old World are spouting about the setting.

Realms of Ruin is a highly tactical game - not strategic, there's no base building to speak of and you won't find yourself managing the tax infrastructure of some sprawling empire. What you WILL be doing is proactively managing battle-winning abilities across a meaty handful of units fighting on multiple fronts, placing a huge emphasis on clever timing, unit positioning, and using the right tool for the right job. 

The roster for each faction is relatively tight and the unit counter circle isn't complex in and of itself, but what that means is that every unit has an opportunity to shine if used correctly. The pace of combat has been called slow - that's intentional, to give players time to make decisions about where and when to utilize abilities to turn the tide of conflict.

When this game is humming, the flow of battle is anything BUT ponderous, as you'll be snapping between fronts, teetering on the knife's edge between disaster and glorious victory, pulling units in and out of the fight, and teeing off abilities at opportune moments to cripple and counter your foes. It's a mighty good time, and even when playing against the AI the game can prove satisfyingly challenging.

If you like games that forego grand strategy and base management in favor of a focus on tactical decision making, tight unit counts, and playmaking through well-time ability usage, you'll have a good time here. Good spiritual comparisons would be Dawn of War 2, Spellforce, and Company of Heroes.","Nov 20, 2023",6.9,,,

jagged alliance 3,PC,Kalev,User,"A few common points of criticism towards the game and my thoughts on why I DISAGREE WITH THOSE:
• No active pause – I think that being able to set up perfect ambushes with your whole squad by executing a number of orders in perfect sync would ruin the experience for me. You can still set up brilliant ambushes by, say, planting a timed explosive and putting most of your squad in overwatch before the turn-based combat starts so that the enemy still suffers a lot of damage in the repositioning phase.
• No chance to hit displayed – while the option has already been provided with an official mod, I seriously don’t get it what so many people are complaining about. You are explicitly shown tons of information about what could affect your chances to hit positively or negatively, sometimes up to 9-10 such data points in my experience. If that were not enough, you actually get a visual indication of whether your attempt is in the sweet spot based on all those factors combined with range.
• Quirky controls – I’ve found it way more easier to go to a different floor as compared with XCOM2. Controls are fairly intuitive and responsive from my point of view, especially appreciating the fact that so much is going on that I can’t really blame the game for not always being fully clear as to what exactly I’m trying to do.
• Enemy knowing where you are – I’ve noticed some reviewers have claimed that the AI knew more than it should. While I appreciate the fact they may have had such experience, I haven’t. I’ve had a number of situations where I’m openly attacking the enemy with part of the squad while some other mercs stay hidden to attack from the flank. It seemed that the AI was only aware of my openly attacking mercs and wasn’t anticipating the hidden mercs that were sometimes literally in front of its way. If they’d been able to do a 1-hit kill with a suppressed sniper, they’d remain hidden and the AI would definitely still be unaware of where they were.
• Ragdoll physics can be subpar; what your merc wears doesn’t change their looks – both statements are correct and I seriously couldn’t care less. I’m here for the gameplay which is brilliant – if that’s at the expense of some more eye candy, then so be it.

What I particularly liked about the game:
• Good and challenging AI even at the lowest difficulty
• I did explore every single tile on the map and I still see a great replayability potential. It’s very much non-linear indeed and you can progress with even some of the major milestones in a campaign by approaching them in a different order. Your decisions do indeed matter in the long term and I bet I could see a lot more from the game even in a third or fourth replay – the point is that it’s not only alternative choices (where I could just explore 100% of those alternatives in a second playthrough) but rather your choices cumulatively also lead to very different outcomes. Side quests are brilliant and very immersive.
• The game came out extremely polished and with more than enough content for it to be called a worthy day one release. That used to be the standard twenty years ago but not really the case anymore so it’s very much worth praising the developers and the publishers for that. I’ve played for more than 60 hours so far and I haven’t had a single crash or any major bug spoiling my experience. The game is also full of so much content that it’s most certainly a fully completed launch – unlike many other moder releases that are launched but only become playable after months and potentially even some paid DLCs.
• Love the projectile ballistics!

What could’ve made the game even better:
• Lacking tutorials – as a newcomer to the game and the series (but definitely not to the genre), I gave up on my first playthrough after about 10 hours because I’d made some fundamental strategy mistakes. I then spent about an hour of watching videos on YouTube with titles like “5 major mistakes to avoid when playing JA3”, etc. After that I had tons of fun with my full 50-hours completionist playthrough. Nevertheless, a proper engaging in-game tutorial would’ve been appreciated. I did my best to try to read all of the text just-in-time tips but felt overwhelmed with the walls of text at some point.
• I mentioned already that I love the projectile ballistics but as much as I was hyped about the destructible terrain, I must say Silent Storm still remains unmatched in that respect. Yes, many objects and parts of the terrain are indeed destructible but I couldn’t help but think all the time how Silent Storm was far superior in that respect. Don’t get me wrong – destruction is good, I’m happy it’s there in the first place, it’s just simply not as absolutely brilliant and fun as it was in Silent Storm.

Despite the two points above, I had so much fun that I realise it's greater than the sum of its parts, hence 10/10.","Aug 3, 2023",8.1,"Nov 16, 2023","The country of Grand Chien is thrown into chaos when the elected president goes missing and the paramilitary force known as “the Legion” seizes control.

ufo robot grendizer the feast of the wolves,PlayStation 5,Forbes,Critic,"Overall, Grendizer is a solid game with a clear love and passion for its classic super robot source material. It’s also very much meant for fans of Grendizer, otherwise much of its appeal and charm will be lost. It also clearly needed more time for polish and general graphical optimization. That said, it still plays decently with these shortcomings and is worth a look for those that want to pilot an old school super robot.","Nov 29, 2023",59,,,
ufo robot grendizer the feast of the wolves,PlayStation 5,Everyeye.it,Critic,"Ufo Robot Grendizer The Feast of Wolves is a game designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts. And nothing else. In Italy the localization operation gave us a magnificent dubbing: adhering to the original also in the choice of timbre of the voice actors and voice actresses, as well as in the tones, vocabulary and theatricality. If you don't get bored of facing about 5 hours of very basic challenges and combat just to enjoy these moments of profound nostalgia, then feel free to raise your final rating by half a point. Perhaps with Ufo Robot by Microids you could make a younger relative experience, in an interactive format, a story from your past: the legend of the ""thousand valve circuits"" and the ""miracle of electronics"" that ""sprints and goes in space"".","Nov 12, 2023",60,,,

It makes little demand for your time and you’re free to spend money to speed things up if you want, no harm, no foul. Other than that, the game is solidly built, the soundtrack is a bit boring, but there’s really nothing overly offensive about it. The question is whether or not you’re willing to put in the time. I’m concerned with how little there is for you to do during those sessions where you’re doing nothing more than trying to earn money but at the end of the day, it’s a nice way to take a break from computer work and video editing like I did during the making of this review.","Mar 26, 2019",70,,,

sakura alien 2,,,Critic,,,tbd,"Nov 10, 2023","In this visual novel Takagi Haru is a normal university student with an abundance of love for the stars. As a member of his university's astronomy club, alongside the sweet but somewhat ditzy Hiyori, Haru means to devote his life to the stars. He doesn't have any time to mess around with cute girls...

At least, that's what he always thought - until an alien princess from another planet, Ena, lands on his lap, and declares herself to be his future wife.

Haru ends up taking Ena in, as she has nowhere else to go, and Ena and Hiyori soon hit it off. Now, the three of them are good friends (or perhaps something more) - but malevolent forces are seeking to undermine their relationship.

A new professor has arrived at Haru's university. She is undoubtedly alluring, and Haru is soon drawn to her - but Professor Sakai seems to have her sights set on Ena.

Has Professor Sakai discovered Ena's secret identity as a runaway alien princess - and what does she mean to do with Ena?",https://www.metacritic.com/game/sakura-alien-2/

shalnor legends 2 trials of thunder,PC,Movies Games and Tech,Critic,"For those looking for a short adventure to pass an evening, Shalnor Legends II is an okay title. My playthrough took me roughly 10 hours or so to see through to the end and was an alright way to pass a weekend. Unfortunately,  there are a lot of better options out there when it comes to the adventure genre. While it is not terrible in any aspect, there are a lot of things that are just okay here. The visuals are passable but with some caveats. Some of the character models look extremely rough and hard to comprehend at first glance. Music is another instance of mediocracy. No tracks really stood out as exceptional or terrible during my time with the game. Everything about Shalnor Legends II just lands below average, making it extremely hard to recommend in a sea of games in the same genre.","Sep 23, 2023",30,,,

tales of arise beyond the dawn,PlayStation 5,Nitroso,User,"TLDR: If you liked Tales of Arise base game, you will like Beyond the Dawn. If you didn’t, then this won’t change your mind.

I fall into the former category and I am happy with this DLC. The game took me about 20 hours to complete and I spent at least 50% of my playtime with a silly grin over getting to see these characters banter and interact again. Although this DLC doesn’t reinvent the wheel—and there are no new combat characters or artes—it does improve on several complaints I had on the 2nd half of the main story. The pacing, dungeon quality, side quest quality, and final boss are a definite step up. If I had to nitpick then I do think the final dungeon dragged on a bit too long, but this was the only time I felt the pacing was off. I enjoyed the focus on Alphen’s arc in this DLC, which was well deserved after Shionne’s arc was arguably the emotional core of the base game.

Overall, this was a wonderful opportunity to reunite with the Arise cast and go on one last well-paced journey that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Would recommend.","Nov 12, 2023",9,,,

I am here to beg, to implore you, to INSIST that you take the time to check out The Invincible if it looks like something you would even be remotely interested in.

ea sports wrc,PC,YeahNah,User,"Personally would rate it 9/10 but people are scoring 1/10 for stutters?
______________________________________________________

Comparison to past Dirt Rally titles/Generations:
- Stages from 17 countries instead of 6, the stages have a lot more design and environmental variety that really elevates the fun factor. A vital component, the main challenge of Rally, is the roads, and EA WRC does this multiple factors better than past Dirt Rally entries. The benefit perceived here compared to the compromise in overall visuals is hands down elevates the gameplay experience, so the move to UE was well worth it.
______________________________________________________
<< Driving physics >> similar underpinnings to DR 2.0 but with overall more grip (makes the game move a bit towards the sim-cade end of the spectrum, making it more accessible to general consumers). However I feel this is not a detriment, in fact I honestly prefer WRC's driving model over DR 2.0's, because the feel of the car is better on a wheel. Once the settings are dialed in to how I had it in DR2.0 (reduced settings besides Self-align, Suspension, Tyre Slip to 60%), you feel more in the FFB than in DR, better gravel texture, feedback through bumps/crests/dips are intuitive and as you would expect, tyre slip when understeering especially on tarmac is also great. 
<< Tarmac physics >> expect much higher cornering speeds (simcade), but with much better feel of the surface which IMO makes it actually fun to drive on tarmac compared to DR2.0. You feel the car has traction and you can really lean into the turns which still require you to keep within the tyre's grip limit.
<< WRC1 car physics >> amazing, better than Generations. The way the car dives diagonally on its compliant suspension as you balance it on the brakes slowing from a straight to a curve is just like you would expect from watching WRC as the downforce does its work. Flinging the car around tight turns and exploiting gear 1/2 for 4wd oversteer works as you'd expect and is lots of fun.
<< Other cars >> expect the same quality as the WRC1 cars as expected from DR2.0, better hands down than in Generations especially the sounds. Greatly improves the career experience as the new structure leans into its pool of rally cars outside of the WRC route.
______________________________________________________
<< Career >> actually really well designed. For the people complaining it strays too far from the main WRC events, you can just skip the invitationals/other events and choose to rest on the weeks that don't have WRC events. For everyone else, it gives you the opportunity to enter other championships using its many other car classes, and gives you a taste of special cars for free in Invitationals. It's a constant rotisserie of all types of rally cars and stages around the world. Better than DR2.0 that locks you into one car class for a whole year, let alone Generations. There is not so much micro-managing your team so you get to race more often which is good, but upgrading your engineers to reduce cost/time of repairs is always nice. Benefactor system means you can borrow huge amounts of money to take a Group B for a spin at the risk of Max's happiness meter, which is always nice.
<< Damage >> I run Hardcore damage and no Restarts, which IMO makes career so much better. I have to drive carefully and have to decide when to push. Car damage is really well balanced with the Service repair allowance so you actively weigh the risk of taking on more damage from pushing or mitigate damage. In longer services you get 30mins which is enough to repair 2 or so major components which do affect your pace. DR 2.0 I found the car barely gets damaged so services are trivial.
______________________________________________________
<< Graphics >> I run this on a mid-spec PC (AMD 5600X and Radeon 6700XT) 1440p ultrawide, medium graphics, 70fps. I don't care that DR2.0 has better car reflections, I love driving the stages in WRC. I encounter stutters in 1/10 stages. Once Codemasters patch out these performance issues, the game's a 10.

my time at sandrock,PC,Shouldsleep,User,One of the best life sim farming games ever made and has the best story I've ever seen in one too. I'm 120 hours in now with so much left to do.,"Nov 21, 2023",10,"Nov 2, 2023","My Time at Sandrock-Just like My Time at Portia, takes place in a wholesome post-apocalyptic world around 300 years after the Day of Calamity.

You'll take a job offer in the city-state of Sandrock, assume the role of a fledgling Builder being sent to a wild and rugged townscape. It's up to you and your trusty toolset to gather resources, build machines, and fix up your workshop into a well-oiled production machine, and save the town from the jaws of economic ruin, as well as a few other unexpected complications.

Key Features:

CUSTOMIZE AND BUILD YOUR WORKSHOP: You'll have an intricate set of machines that all work together to produce parts of huge structures for the town that you assemble piece by piece, or head to your worktable to craft hundreds of unique items that can help out individual townspeople or be placed throughout your own homestead.

EXPLORE THE OPEN WORLD: You'll explore the vast deserts surrounding Sandrock, diving into ruins to find ancient relics from the Old World, facing the dangers of dungeons and their denizens, then return to your homestead with encumbering bags of treasure in tow.

vampire the masquerade justice,PC,COGconnected,Critic,"Vampire: The Masquerade-Justice is a stealth-action RPG that’s a convincing fit for VR. The core gameplay is pretty standard, and character models are a bit disappointing, but its implementation in VR, coupled with excellent environmental design and lighting, help sell the experience. New Meta Quest 3 or PS VR2 owners with a taste for virtual blood will enjoy spending time in Venice’s virtual world of shadows.","Oct 30, 2023",66,,,

blasphemous 2,PlayStation 5,Windolicker,User,"I love this game and the game that preceded it. They are the best platformer/metroidvanias I personally have ever played. There are moments that feel utterly cinematic; the height of pixel art. All of which is dramatically more satisfying and immersive when following the story. Which, if I had one complaint, is a little difficult to interpret. All of the puzzle pieces that are given in item descriptions and dialogue, end up falling a little short when it comes to giving a complete picture of what exactly is happening. However, as much as it is a **** also feels a bit like a positive. The story leaves you with questions and it also leaves some things up for interpretation. As much as that fact can frustrate, it also can be a lot of fun. Sometimes being given all of the answers takes the fun out of things.

I completed a single playthrough of Thirsty Suitors in about 12 hours, yet felt like I had known Timber Hills and its inhabitants far longer than that. I genuinely related to Thirsty Suitors in ways I’ve never connected to a video game before and would love to revisit Jala and company in DLC or a sequel. Thirsty Suitors isn’t just a stock game with a Bollywood veneer; it’s an entity that showcases both obvious and subtle aspects of South Asian culture in the West.

However,  it is still a fun game to play and has some good variations in the types of games which can be played.  If a person is looking to kill some time and play a classic fun card game on the console,  Uno is the game to definitely buy.  One con I will mention though is the pricing.  $14.99 is a bit steep for a simple card game but not a deal breaker.","Aug 20, 2016",8,,,

Sadly, the problems that were present in the 2018 release of Roller Coaster Tycoon Adventures persist in Roller Coaster Tycoon Adventures Deluxe. It’s plagued with bugs, technical issues, and some plain odd UI decisions. You get more of almost everything, but what the game really needed is nowhere to be found.

nfl pro era ii,PlayStation 5,Hardcore Gamer,Critic,"NFL PRO ERA II offers a solid update over the original and this one would be the one to pick up for those who missed the first one. It’s only thirty dollars on PSVR 2 and offers a type of immersion that isn’t seen anywhere else. The improved controls are certainly that, but still far from perfect. The continuous Career Mode is a surface level addition, but like much with this game with proper investment, there’s a lot more that could go into it. The fact that you can only play as a created player no matter the mode or team is both a blessing and a curse. It would be great to play with different quarterbacks of different sizes and attributes. You are playing against these players, after all. The multiplayer that was added is basically non-existent unless you have a friend who has a headset. The mini-games are more frustrating than they are fun, but the quickest way to play with friends is the Two-Minute Drill. This, and the practice mode, is the best way to get the feel for the game. NFL PRO ERA II is a must play for any football fan who has a headset to use with VR and space to play.","Dec 7, 2023",70,"Oct 31, 2023","Step under center and show the world you're an elite QB this 2023 season in the latest NFL and NFLPA-licensed VR experience, NFL PRO ERA II.

fur squadron,Nintendo Switch,NintendoWorldReport,Critic,"Where FUR Squadron struggles is in its content. A playthrough only lasts around twenty-five minutes.

FUR Squadron is a reasonably well executed love letter to Star Fox and rail shooters in general, and it is clear that the potential is there for this developer to pull off something of a much larger scale.

You can’t save at a seemingly important choice and go back and see the other path, but you have to play again, and you will notice a whole different outcome.

slender the arrival,PC,babylonianark60,User,"Slender: The Arrival is a true masterpiece of the horror genre, offering an experience that's not just spine-tingling but also emotionally gripping. It's one of those rare games that transcends typical jump scares and shallow storytelling to deliver an unforgettable, nerve-wracking journey that will haunt your dreams for nights to come.

The game's atmosphere is its most outstanding feature. From the moment you step into the eerie woods, the oppressive silence and the distant echoes of footsteps keep you on the edge of your seat. The environmental design is absolutely brilliant, with every detail contributing to the overwhelming sense of dread. The use of darkness and shadows is impeccable, making every step you take feel like a heart-pounding gamble.

The narrative, while relatively simple, is told in a way that pulls you deeper into the mystery. As you uncover the story through various notes, audio recordings, and unsettling encounters, you'll find yourself both desperate to escape and oddly compelled to understand the horrors that lie in the shadows.

One of the game's defining features is its monster, the Slender Man himself. This faceless, enigmatic entity is relentless in his pursuit, and the developers have nailed the art of building tension through his appearances. It's impossible to describe the sheer terror of turning around and finding him standing there, his featureless face staring into your soul. The fear he instills is genuine and spine-chilling.

Gameplay mechanics are simple yet effective, making every task, like collecting pages or restoring power, a daunting challenge in the face of Slender Man's relentless pursuit. The controls are responsive, and the first-person perspective immerses you completely in the experience. The occasional switch to different characters adds variety and keeps you invested in the unfolding narrative.

The graphics and sound design are top-notch. The game's visuals are hauntingly beautiful, and the audio, from the distant footsteps to the sudden bursts of white noise, is expertly crafted to send shivers down your spine.

Slender: The Arrival is not just a game; it's an emotional rollercoaster that taps into primal fears. It's a horror experience that transcends the medium, leaving a lasting impression that will stay with you long after the credits roll. In the world of horror gaming, Slender: The Arrival is an absolute must-play, setting a standard that few games can hope to match. It's a testament to the power of interactive storytelling and the ability to terrify us in ways no other form of media can. If you're a horror fan, or even if you're not, do yourself a favor and experience the fear, tension, and brilliance of Slender: The Arrival.","Oct 26, 2023",6.1,,,

soulcalibur broken destiny,PSP,ty92,User,So I just got a PSP 3000 yesterday. I used to have the 1000 when it came out years ago. I got platinum for Soulcalibur 6 on PS4. And I also have Soulcalibur 4 on PS3. So Soulcalibur Broken Destiny was the first PSP game I bought. I downloaded it from PSN on my PS3 and copied it over to my PSP. That's the only way you can download games for PSP now in 2020... But I have to say this game looks and plays great. It looks a lot like Soulcalibur 4. This is a must buy if you have a PSP. I just wish I could play Soulcalibur 6 on it. But I love that this version has Kratos from God of War. The character customization isn't great like in other Soulcalibur games. I wish it was better. But I am still impressed by this game on PSP.,"May 1, 2020",7.0,,,

Playing this title is frustrating and the problems go far beyond the facets of the protagonist that have gone viral on social media.

the caligula effect 2,PlayStation 4,RPG Fan,Critic,"Ultimately, The Caligula Effect 2 is not a game for everyone. This is something the developers are keenly aware of. It’s not a flashy, high-budget, big-name, auteur-laden, AAA RPG that’s gone through the gauntlet of playtesters and focus groups. It’s a scrappy, low-budget underdog that’s full of heart and empathy, and it has a message to share. Though the game is a sequel, those interested can certainly start with this version, as its predecessor is vaguely recapped. For the few like myself who enjoyed the original game despite its numerous flaws, this follow-up is a dramatic glow up that deserves to be played. It is easily one of my favorite games this year.","Nov 14, 2021",65,"Oct 17, 2023","Dive into a reality-warping adventure from Persona scenario-writer Tadashi Satomi and director Takuya Yamanaka!

overpass 2,Xbox Series X,XboxAddict,Critic,"As with the first game, Overpass 2 is not what one would consider a traditional racing game given the events you participate in and the sim-like management of your team. You will be frustrated when you first start playing, even if you’ve gone through the tutorial, but push through and it gets somewhat better. Like the original, the foundations of something cool is here. I know when I reviewed the first game, I hoped that there would be a sequel with improvements in various areas, and although there are some, Overpass 2 still has annoyances that continue to hold the franchise back. The experiment of the first game continued with the release of a second, but the result is one that feels like it could have used more time. So, the major question is: “Dare I wish for a third kick at the can?”. In some ways yes, but they need to take the time to make improvements, or the third time could be unlucky.","Dec 13, 2023",60,"Oct 17, 2023","Building on the studio's experience in racing games and feedback from players of the first game, OVERPASS 2 will offer a more in-depth and improved experience.

Yet anchored in a very classic formula which could have been detrimental to it, Lords of the Fallen does not rest on the laurels of others and delivers some interesting ideas which set it apart from the competition. Despite everything, the title still has too many small flaws and frustrations to climb to the top of the rankings.

the grinch christmas adventures,Xbox Series X,Movies Games and Tech,Critic,"The Grinch: Christmas Adventures is a fantastic and festive platforming experience. Furthermore, it is ideal for kids and lovers of Dr Seuss. Control either the Grinch or Max as you carry out a devious plan to destroy Christmas for the Whos. With easy-to-follow controls, whimsy audio, and hand-drawn imagery, this feels, sounds, and looks wonderful. Its only shortcoming is a lack of replay value.","Oct 17, 2023",80,,,

mercenaries lament requiem of the silver wolf,Nintendo Switch,Digitally Downloaded,Critic,"I hope Rideon continues to produce Mercenaries titles. They’re genuinely entertaining as “no-frills” examples of the tactics JRPG genre. However, the Switch has so many of them now. Recent years have brought us the incredible remake of Tactics Ogre, the stunning Triangle Strategy, and earlier this year we got, arguably, the finest Fire Emblem to date. I don’t expect Rideon to get to that standard, and I think there’s plenty of room for a “no frills” and inexpensive little experience in between the big guns, but I would still like to see the series continue to evolve, rather than simply find ways to continue to repackage the existing assets.","May 8, 2023",60,,,

It brings together an interesting story with some strong performances and a topical site of anxiety. At a run time of about 45 minutes for each playthrough this is perfect for a quick play with a glass of wine but may not feel like the best value. There's plenty of replayability though if you want to unlock all the endings, but many of them involve only slight variations of events you’ll have seen before. Night Book is very much an FMV interactive experience rather than a game but it is undoubtedly a solid example of its kind.

It doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't suffer from the prepubescent and ear-bleeding writing and banter of Ace Combat 7. Fans of the series will greatly appreciate this and fans of simulators like me, will also love this. Our genre is really starved of good games. As a project made by only a two-man team, this game is just marvelous. I especially like how the aircraft are much more detailed and have better styling than in Ace Combat. You can tell that this game was built with passion with so many fine details, down to the camo of the planes to the messy skies with smoke trails and debris everywhere to the way planes fall to the ground while burning. It is also significantly harder than Ace Combat and the missions are more complex, longer and loaded with numerous targets. The missiles perform better and the planes handle much better than in Ace Combat. Project Wingman is not too realistic, but enjoyable on so many levels. The soundtrack is also insanely good.

synergia,PC,PublicNuisance,User,"Synergia has some of the best overall presentation and atmosphere of any visual novel I have played. Everything from the opening video; to the menus; to the music; to the art are all top notch. It all ties together to just ooze cyberpunk out of every crevice. The story itself isn’t bad but it gets really rushed near the end and the ending just feels abrupt. The romantic relationship between Mara and Cila also feels a little forced and rushed. They go from cold and awkward to saying how they love each other within a matter of days with nothing in between. There is also a ton of story dumped on the reader in the last half hour or so which makes keeping track of new developments and characters an issue only for the game to abruptly end anyway. The endings were another issue of mine. The store page lists “multiple endings” but in truth there are only two. Now two is more than one so they’re not lying exactly but when I see “multiple endings” I expect several different ones. Even worse is that to access the epilogue you need to have completed both endings. My real issue with that is that there is a single epilogue, which means that regardless of which ending you get the epilogue doesn’t change at all. Overall the game just lacks choices and branching. It’s not a kinetic novel but it also isn’t really choice driven. It’s stuck in an uncomfortable no man’s land. I really wished that the game had developed the character “Rat” more as well as had more of Darla.

I played Synergia on Linux. It never crashed and I didn’t notice any spelling errors. You can save whenever you want and there are one hundred forty four save slots. Alt-Tab didn’t work.

Synergia isn’t a bad game, in fact it was very close to being a great game, but the story sinks it near the end to where it is hard to  recommend it. There are worse visual novels out there but also better ones. It’s a shame because aside from the story the game has so much going for it. I finished my first play through in three hours and nine minutes and I paid $13.49 CAD for it. That isn’t terrible value but also not fantastic. I think sub $10 is a better price range for it.

The game needs some more ironing to its wings to get rid of the bugs and seriously tone down the ridiculous time limits to really take off.

The game follows the story of 2 guys Jack and Amelia, during the WWII
Let me say the story is fiction , so do not exepect anything super real ,but that's the point, everything is told as an Interview to the old 90yo pilots, kinda of fun indeed.
Interview 3d models aren't so great althougt the storytelling isn't that bad, despite voiceover doesn't shine, but this is not the reason why you buy this game isn't it ?
Where the game letterally shines is in the game itself , it starts quite slow , the first missions are short and ment to be tutorials ,althoug I flew over NY tutorial for hours for my personal enjoyment ! simply amazing !.
But when the battle begins, oh boy ,you'll never stop until you did it ! Sometimes could be hard , but it's because you need to find the correct approach to knock down the objectives.
But I don't want to spoil anything , you have to figure it out by yourself. Maybe some missions are a bit longer than they should be or a bit hard but it isn't a big deal afterall

The limited narrative works well for it, mostly because players can focus on the combat and on how they can improve their performance.

wo long fallen dynasty conqueror of jiangdong,PlayStation 5,PlayStation LifeStyle,Critic,"Team Ninja still can’t tell stories, though, as Conqueror of Jiangdong’s cutscenes are nonsensical and haphazardly stitched together to justify going to each level. And while the plot doesn’t matter here, it is yet another example of how the studio is treading water with Conqueror of Jiangdong. This sophomore expansion includes some amazing boss fights, but ones that are still sullied by unhelpful allies and relegated to side missions. These hiccups sit on top of the game’s small pile of problems that is slowly growing as the DLC rolls out. Wo Long is still a quality action game and Conqueror of Jiangdong is a reminder of that, but it also points out — and magnifies — its weaknesses.","Oct 5, 2023",60,,,

cyberpunk 2077 phantom liberty,PC,PCWorld,Critic,"Phantom Liberty is CD Projekt RED’s masterpiece. Not only is Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty graphically easily three generations ahead of the entire industry and redefines how we experience video games with pathtracing, it’s also written even more thrillingly and staged even more explosively. Anyone who doesn’t enjoy this several times in different play styles has never loved video games. A clear must-play.","Oct 15, 2023",89,,,
cyberpunk 2077 phantom liberty,PC,Worth Playing,Critic,"Except for some lingering bugs and other graphical issues, the Phantom Liberty DLC serves as an ideal swan song for this iteration of Cyberpunk 2077. The story is gripping from beginning to end thanks to some expected but exciting plot twists, a big diverging point in the story that occurs way before the end of the campaign, and some very memorable and fleshed-out characters. The tale may be somewhat self-contained, but the ties to the rest of the city make it feel like a proper expansion versus something completely siloed off from the rest of the game. That would be a good enough reason for existing fans to take the plunge, but given the various changes made by patch 2.0, it's a game that's definitely worth jumping into if you've been waiting for a good chunk of the issues to get cleared up.","Sep 24, 2023",90,,,
cyberpunk 2077 phantom liberty,PC,marceloguedes,User,"Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty (v2.1) redeemed itself grandiosely. It went from being impossible to play in 2020 due to the sheer volume of bugs, to one of the best open-world experiences of my life. 
Now, the great sci-fi story can shine, with another incredible chapter in Phantom Liberty exploring more aspects of the universe, with fun gameplay, out-of-the-charts songs, and tons of content. Everything just works now. It is a must-play.","Dec 13, 2023",7.0,,,
cyberpunk 2077 phantom liberty,PC,FVpeanut,User,"Phantom Liberty brings a visceral narrative to the already soul-gripping adventure of Cyberpunk. V finds themselves on another pilgrimage fueled with espionage and intrigue, and must plunge deep into a web of broken loyalties, and political power plays to save the President of the NUSA with the help of FIA Agent Solom Reed. (played by Idris Elba)  	

In the pulsating heart of the megalopolis that is Night City, we find ourselves in a self-governed combat zone that is Dogtown. Contacted by FIA Agent Intelligence analyst, Song So Mi ""Songbird"", with the promise of helping V to eliminate the biochip lodged in their head, V must help to save the President of the NUSA Rosalind Myers, as Space Force One crashes in Dogtown.  	

While adding a compelling new narrative to Cyberpunk, Phantom Liberty adds a plethora of new weapons, a new skill tree, gigs, and side quests, to the abundance of activities that make up Night City. From completing side gigs for ‘Mr. Hands’ to completing quests that add to the story within Phantom Liberty, you’ll find yourself fully submerged for hours within Dogtown. 	

Phantom Liberty adds a stellar lineup of characters to help fill out the narrative. Colonel  Hansen, a veteran of the ‘Unification War’ rules with an iron fist with the help of his militia, ‘Barghest Soldiers. Alex is an aspiring braindance actress turned FIA agent whose shapeshifting abilities make her a powerful tool within the FIA. Solomon Reed (played by Idris Elba) has a dossier filled with assassination attempts, successful negotiation attempts with kidnappers, and multiple sabotage operations and coups in South American republics. His last mission was to help build a successful spy network within Night City during the ‘Unification War’. In 2070 after realizing the war was a lost cause the NUSA disbanded his cell and he dropped off the radar. So Mi ""Songbird"" is President Myers’ right hand and an incredibly powerful netrunner. Rosalind Myers is the former CEO of Militech and is currently in her third term as President of the New United States of America. 	

I was enamored with the abundance of detail within Dogtown. From the swarming shop-packed ‘EBM Petrochem Stadium’ that breathes like a modern-day shopping mall to the larger-than-life neon-light pyramid that is ‘Heavy Hearts Club’, CD PROJEKT RED perfectly immerses you in the Cyberpunk universe. 

My initial journey with Cyberpunk was a sour one. After experiencing multiple game-breaking bugs at launch, I had given up. Periodically checking in with each update but never feeling that investment like I did with ‘The Witcher 3’. Then came update 2.0 and I was hooked. Then comes Phantom Liberty forever cementing Cyberpunk: 2077 into my top five games within the new decade, if not the top three. 

Phantom Liberty is CD PROJEKT RED at perfection. An encapsulating story, breathtaking visuals, deep and compelling characters, and a spy thriller that culminates in an almost alien-like game of cat and mouse. Phantom Liberty is a must-buy.","Dec 8, 2023",10,,,
terraformers,PC,Softpedia,Critic,"Terraformers is an engaging game that can deliver that “one more turn” feeling that strategy fans crave. The interplay between resources, cards, leaders, and terraforming efforts requires careful thinking and asks players to make difficult choices. There’s a lot of variety both when it comes to scenario objectives and the planet setup. The card flow might be too random for some players but I find the uncertainty it creates a good way to keep tension and difficulty up. After a while, there’s also a sense that leader abilities repeat a little too often. But these are minor issues with a very good strategy and resource management game.

Join either Mr. Kolth or Mrs.Hartfort as they both try to make sense of a hellish adventure that leads them into the depths of their own psyche and back again.
Live through their difference of reality-gaze which merges fiction and ethereal dream sequences and go on to fight against evil in this dimension…and the next.
Matthew Kolth is a paranormal investigator at the turn of the century that takes on a new case at Hartford Mansion. There he meets Della, the wife of a rich businessman that believes her house to be haunted. She sees visions of demons and beasts of other dimensions.
As a player, we have two deliberate choices: We either pick Matthew or Della, and both alternatives offer completely different play styles and adventures.
Matthew must journey through the dream-like yet horror filled halls of the Hartford mansion before heading to Carcosa Asylum in pursuit of Della and the answers she holds. You must guide him from the bone chilling depths of his own psyche and back into stability all the while fighting terrifying monsters and trying to solve mind bending puzzles to progress through the game.

No two runs are ever the same, which keeps you at the top of your game, and makes Days of Doom inherently replayable.",https://www.metacritic.com/game/days-of-doom/
payday 3,PC,Jeuxvideo.com,Critic,"If it doesn't reinvent the wheel, Payday 3 modernizes its four-player heist formula with accuracy and intelligence, and that's all we ask of it. The eight missions available to date are well done - and make excellent use of the few new mechanics. All in all, the life of a “controller in hand” thug is still just as demanding. Even if we can criticize a slight lack of content, especially for the arsenal, this third part already sticks to the skin with a system of skills, difficulty modes which always make you want to start again and achieve the ideal run. A superb foundation for the future.","Sep 21, 2023",67,"Sep 21, 2023","PAYDAY 3 is the sequel to one of the most popular co-op shooters ever. Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That’s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience without equal. Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement. The legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake. In order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan. Give outlet to your greed and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash and jewelry and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics and accolades. It won’t be as simple as showing up and gaining goodies. You’ll have to work hard and plan smart to get away with as much loot as possible. Gain experience, unlock new skills and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges. A professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays. Not just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist.

resident evil 4 separate ways,PlayStation 5,TheGamer,Critic,"Separate Ways is so good that it makes other Resident Evil games look worse by comparison. It’s hard to believe that this campaign was only $10 when Resident Evil 3 Remake, a game of similar length yet far less satisfying, was full price just three years ago. It’s even more surprising that just last year we were playing Shadows of Rose, a lightweight, uninspiring retread of Resident Evil Village that similarly tried to make old locales feel new again, but failed to match the quality of the base game. Separate Ways is more like a Resident Evil 2-style parallel campaign than a bonus DLC, and it’s been given the level of polish and care it deserves. Separate Ways has always been essential to the RE4 experience, but the remake elevates it to the quality of a standalone Resident Evil game. And at just $10, it might be the best value in gaming this year.","Sep 25, 2023",88,,,

From the dopamine hits provided by exploring the labyrinthine level layouts, to the extreme elation of finally besting a challenging boss, there’s nary a moment of Lies of P‘s meaty campaign that feels wasted or unsatisfactory.

ad infinitum,PC,Tyvan,User,"As a lifelong gamer, horror fan, history buff, and combat veteran, I really wanted to like this game. But it was an all around “meh” experience for me. While I appreciated the gameplay not being overly difficult, that’s about the only positive I have.

One thing I absolutely hated were the parts where “your actions have consequences”, but I had no idea what my options were, because they aren’t presented to you clearly at all, but also affect which ending you get. I felt that was pretty unfair. I had to watch a video to figure out what to do at two parts in the game, which ****. 

The controls are beyond janky, what with the strange thumbstick  twisting mechanic. Not unplayable, just annoying and not very fun to use controls like that.

Also, the game was not scary… like, at all. There are some creepy looking monsters, but that’s it. They aren’t scary, just creepy. I didn’t really ever feel anxious enough to panic or fumble anything.

The first person POV of his hands and arms and the rifle are super goofy looking to the point of immersion breaking.

the crew motorfest,PlayStation 5,Gaming Age,Critic,"Overall, I’d say The Crew Motorfest is a big step up from the prior games in the series, and gives some hope for additional variety in open world racers in the future. Granted, it sticks pretty close to the same formula that Forza Horizon has, but there’s enough differences between the two to make this still feel like a worthwhile use of your time. It’s a gorgeous game in motion as well, which doesn’t hurt. As far as complaints go, mine are pretty minor, in that I don’t care for the limited fast travel system that’s only tied to the intro areas for each Playlist, and I wish the server didn’t time out as quickly as it does when you go idle.

Classic Bomberman grid mechanics with neat twists in additional modes, with new rules to keep things fresh.

Does it push beyond Super Bomberman R? In some ways, yes, but there could well have been more to take this sequel to the next level.

the expanse a telltale series episode 4,PC,RPG Fan,Critic,"Episode 4 leaves behind intense mixed feelings. It’s the second episode in a row where the series brings everything that belongs in a classic Telltale game. This installment explores Camina’s past in a much cooler way than a standard flashback. And The Expanse now adds new dimensions to the TV series, especially Camina’s character. Yet, it also feels like the developers had been holding out, not bringing out the most compelling elements of the series until it’s almost over. It gives them momentum for the ending, but why did they wait so long, knowing there’s limited space for this story? I’m still interested to see how it ends and whether there will be some sort teaser for another season.

a robot named fight,Nintendo Switch,Zombiemouse,User,"ARNF is definitely worth the money that's for sure.  If you're considering picking it up here's the pros and cons:

Pros:
The randomized level design is spot on, and really gives you that feeling that you're playing Super Metroid for the first time as a child.
It's super satisfying killing the gooey meat monsters.
The powerups are endless and rarely disappoint.
Every time you play the game, you are not only faced with a new randomized level/maze that can be completed in one sitting, but each time you play you're practically guaranteed to find a powerup you've never seen before.
The more you play, the more powerups you unlock for future runs.
The game as a whole is not so challenging that you're going to give up.
The entire game was made by ONE GUY!  Support this man, as he deserves all the prase!
He's often looking through and responding to forums, so he seems to listen to feedback quite well.
Did I mention infinite replayability?  How many PvE games can make that claim?  Zero that's how many.
Cons:  Sometimes randomness kills your run?  I don't like the randomness of the upgrade stations.  I wish their was an option to donate 99 scrap to see a list of potential upgrades or something.  The dumb overlord robots give you ""lil' whoever"" too much.  Also shield drones are lame.  Feels bad to get lame upgrades.  When you get something good that compliments your other upgrades it feels great though, just wish it was more common.

TL;DR
Game is very good, and was created by a single person.  Scratches that Super Metroid Itch for eternity with a new experience each time you play.  Roguelikes are not for everyone though, and some runs you'll waste hours before you see that luck has reduced your chances greatly.

They have remained neutral in the many squabbles between the kingdoms, selling fuel to all sides. Each kingdom knows that if they were to try to take Terroir for their own, the other four kingdoms would put aside their differences to stop them.

However, in the past years, the Argus Empire has been growing in strength, and this balance has been disturbed. Argus ships darkened the skies of Terroir and began their assault. When the City Council attempted to contact the other kingdoms for reinforcements, they found that their signal was being jammed. If they can't send a distress signal, it will be months before the other kingdoms will become aware of the situation, in which time Argus will be able to take control of the city and entrench their defenses.

escape from terror city,,,User,,,,"Sep 6, 2023","The mining colony of Terroir, though relatively small and isolated, is vitally important to the five interplanetary kingdoms in the sector, due to being their only source for the raw materials which fuel their space vessels. They have remained neutral in the many squabbles between the kingdoms, selling fuel to all sides. Each kingdom knows that if they were to try to take Terroir for their own, the other four kingdoms would put aside their differences to stop them.

However, in the past years, the Argus Empire has been growing in strength, and this balance has been disturbed. Argus ships darkened the skies of Terroir and began their assault. When the City Council attempted to contact the other kingdoms for reinforcements, they found that their signal was being jammed. If they can't send a distress signal, it will be months before the other kingdoms will become aware of the situation, in which time Argus will be able to take control of the city and entrench their defenses.

teenage mutant ninja turtles shredders revenge 2023,PC,Zski,User,"This is exactly what the base game was missing.

This doesn't reinvent the game, but it adds the fresh coat of paint that I wanted. It gives you enough reason to return to the game and keep playing. The two new characters are actually very fun to use, and while the color swaps aren't huge, they're a fun little bonus to those coming back and for long-time fans of the series. The survival mode is the core appeal of the DLC. Its exactly what you would expect of it, but it adds a few fun features, such as being able to play as some of the bosses. Again, nothing game changing, but they tapped into exactly what fans wanted and needed to get back into the game.

Enemies tend to appear in groups, and while you try to freeze or shoot one of them, another one attacks you from the side or behind. I hope they release an update that allows slower combat.

Their are fishing challenges to do at certain places, but with no info you spend 4 hrs driving around instead of fast traveling and spending 4 hrs fishing.

Without the music it feels like you are really down there, alone with your thoughts and the sounds of the ocean. Being a big fan of the Abyss movie, I really liked the game a lot.

After a few hours, I encountered an extremely annoying bug: PS5 error CE-100028-1 pop-ups constantly (“no free space for save” but I had over 160 gb free space). Rebooting my ps5 did the trick but unfortunately the error did come back after some time.

The swimming controls are a bit weird, but the little submarine you are in feels great to maneuver. Even with the flaws and some glitches (I was stuck 3 times while swimming and collecting stuff and had to reload) I highly recommend the game. Get down there and see for yourself.

sea of stars,PC,GameGrin,Critic,Sea of Stars is an amazing-looking and sounding title that has captured all you love from classic turn-based RPGs and improved upon it.

A prequel story set in The Messenger's universe, it tells the story of two Children of the Solstice who will combine the powers of the sun and moon to perform Eclipse Magic, the only force capable of fending off the monstrous creations of the evil alchemist known as The Fleshmancer. 

Promising the Sabotage touch in every system, Sea of Stars aims to modernize the classic RPG in terms of turn-based combat, storytelling, exploration and interactions with the environment, while still offering a hearty slice of nostalgia and good old, simple fun.

 Key ingredients :

* Engaging turn-based combat. Combat gameplay includes active player input during attack animations (timed hits), multi-character combo attacks, boosting, and strategic defense options to hinder enemies while they are channeling powerful attacks or spells. For a more immersive experience, there are no random encounters or transitions to separate battlefields, and no grinding. Both navigation and combat happen in the same environment.
* Unshackled traversal. Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you run through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tile-based movement.
* Prequel story set in The Messenger's universe. Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you've come to expect from a Sabotage production.
* Full-on dynamic lighting our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.
* The Sabotage treatment on the turn-based RPG genre. Every system has been deeply analyzed to create an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while reworking some elements in order to offer a modernized experience free of irritants and overly lengthy sequences.",https://www.metacritic.com/game/sea-of-stars/

Despite the fact that it starts very slow, there’s a lot of enjoyable content hidden under the guise of a standard turn-based strategy game. If you love the Fire Emblem series or just looking for an XCOM-style strategy game, Lost Eidolons is well worth your time.

lost eidolons,PC,Armitas,User,"Best game I have played in a long time. The story is so good, and the progress of the battle so detailed that it makes you wonder if you are playing a game based on books, or a movie. Combat is strategic with various options and builds for each character. Graphics are fantastic. Music is good, but appears to have been used in other games. Combat animations are very satisfying. With a new game+ it has lots of replay value which allows you to play stronger and get more rapport with the characters.

I only experienced two issues.
1) If you have the graphics up high, the UI can be sluggish. I never experienced sluggish combat, just in the UI.

ride 5,PlayStation 5,Spc1971,User,"I've always been tempted to get a Ride game, but for one reason or another, always talked myself out of it. With this latest installment being only next gen, I figured that now was as good a time as ever.
This game has so far exceeded all of my expectations. Granted, they weren't that low in the first place, but I now regret not giving this series a chance sooner.

Graphics are top notch, especially with the dynamic weather (which is unreal). The gameplay however is extremely challenging in my opinion.

In my favorite racing game of all time, Gran Turismo, even though it's a simulation, running into the occasional wall never completely hinders my race process. In Ride 5, the slightest collision or steep turn will cause you to fall off of your bike, which will more than not, cause you to lose that top spot. I appreciate this difficult yet realistic feature.

Bottom line, I really do love this game. It will take a lot more hours than I originally thought, but the graphics and overall feel are smooth combination for one of my favorite games of the year.","Sep 2, 2023",8,"Aug 24, 2023","Rev up your engine and get ready to hit the track with RIDE 5.

the expanse a telltale series episode 3,PC,RPG Fan,Critic,"With this secondary universe within the universe of The Expanse, it feels as though there’s too much happening to wrap up with two short episodes to go. Though it’s still way too early to predict, it’s possible what’s here and absent currently could be pointing to a second season. If that’s where the series is headed, it should eventually make for a more substantial experience than if Episode 5 is the full-stop end. The show won’t bend around to connect back to the game, as it’s over. Or is it? In any case, hopefully two more episodes will bring clarity to the limbo where The Expanse currently resides. After the cliffhanger ending of Episode 3, I’m excited to see how Camina gets out of this one and how the rest of her story will play out.","Sep 17, 2023",68,,,

immortals of aveum,PlayStation 5,aidenjames007,User,"Don’t understand how people are giving this such low scores, it was a lot of fun! The game was smooth, and graphics were good; only a few minor flickers maybe once or twice an hour. The fights were smooth, fast, enjoyable and had many variations which was nice. Boss fights were quite diverse, which was a great change to many similar style games where boss fights become basically the same thing every time. I enjoyed the small puzzles as well, not so many it gets annoying and repetitive like many others. The story was different and unique, plus who doesn’t like magic! 

Some of the low ratings had nothing to do with the game itself, for example, not liking EA, or not wanting to call a female “sir”, or other such reasons. If you’re going to judge a game, then rate the game based on things like graphics, gameplay, style, weaponry, skills/abilities, character customization, level progression, etc… not your personal beliefs in the proper use of pronouns, or whether you’re a fan of the creating studio.

Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Moon, and Sun. These four magic stones and the gods of the moon and sun brought prosperity in Megalith. Because of that, the people lived a peaceful and prosperous life.

However, their peaceful life ended when Nebiros and his armies appeared.

A long time ago, during the war of the gods when the world was created, Nebiros was defeated by the gods of the sun and moon. He was locked up by the 4 magic stones but was freed by summoning a country which aims to achieve victory in the war using him.

Nebirus, as an act of revenge, controlled the mind of the god of the moon using his dark power. The god of the universe transformed people's form and spirit into hideous ones and made them as his armies. And the entire Megalith fell into the abyss of destruction and chaos.

Nebirus' army has started to move towards the god of the sun. The god of the sun, who was threatened by Nebirus' move, entrusted the weapons of the gods to 4 dragon knights and ordered them to overthrow Nebirus.

kentucky route zero tv edition,Nintendo Switch,RPG Fan,Critic,"To speak of entrancing elements, head writer Jake Elliott has taken nearly ten years to spin the intoxicating yarn present in this game. He is frequently fussy in his prose (and obtuse in proximity to reality) throughout Kentucky Route Zero but nonetheless deserves a massive amount of praise. He runs with each environmental detail and every stray thought presented by the main characters, giving them ample space to breathe and worm their way into your thoughts. The excellent dialogue and theming are well-supported by Tamas Kemenczy’s polygonal vector art visuals, which suffuse each scene with a haunting beauty fit for this weary, broken world.

kentucky route zero tv edition,Nintendo Switch,Reed618,User,"This is a tough game to recommend because I know its appeal is niche but personally I loved it. One of my favorite games of 2020 :).

If you're a fan of the magical realism genre then this is definitely worth considering. Be warned though that this is a basically a visual novel. You can walk through areas, interact with objects and make dialogue choices and there's some very simple vehicle sections but you're playing it for the story and the artstyle.

The appeal for me comes from the strong character writing. I love how i'm able to shape a character's backstory as well as their choices and how that influences the story. It feels very much like i'm part of a living novel. The way different characters see their reality is conveyed in some interesting ways as well.

kentucky route zero tv edition,Nintendo Switch,RPG Fan,Critic,"To speak of entrancing elements, head writer Jake Elliott has taken nearly ten years to spin the intoxicating yarn present in this game. He is frequently fussy in his prose (and obtuse in proximity to reality) throughout Kentucky Route Zero but nonetheless deserves a massive amount of praise. He runs with each environmental detail and every stray thought presented by the main characters, giving them ample space to breathe and worm their way into your thoughts. The excellent dialogue and theming are well-supported by Tamas Kemenczy’s polygonal vector art visuals, which suffuse each scene with a haunting beauty fit for this weary, broken world. The characters are blank-faced, but they require no expressions to communicate their state of being with clarity and appropriate gravitas.","Jan 19, 2021",90,,,

dust and neon,PC,Softpedia,Critic,"Dust & Neon is fast, exciting, and often challenging. There are a ton of weapons to constantly compare and equip, enabling variety when it comes to the playstyle. The rogue side of the game does not offer a ton of depth but has plenty of reasons to try again when death comes for the cowboy. The game’s universe is a little too conservative and does not embrace the potential weirdness of the cowboy and robots mix. Boss battles can also sometimes feel unfair.

The graphics are wonderful while the world is amazing and many times I just stand enjoying the view. Exploration is at its best and there are many activities and missions to do apart from the main quest. A very nice feature of the game is that the player can move by surfing on the sand. The combat is fantastic and for someone who looks for a challenge setting difficulty at hard is great. Also, by setting difficulty at hard the player is further incentivized to explore the magnificient world in order to find usefull resources to improve his skills. The story is very interesting and kept me looking for more.

atlas fallen,PlayStation 5,Tesseract,User,"Another blatant example of how useless the gaming “journalism” has become. This is a game that knows it’s just a combination of better games - like it’s spiritual predecessor, Darksiders - and I love it for that reason. It isn’t trying to be some grandiose BS or act super duper serious. As one idiot critic says in their review, “Fine isn’t acceptable in 2023”, a tremendously stupid thing to say, particularly considering the insane level of irony having that come from a C-list website and someone part of an industry that keeps lowering its standards. But, alas, being good at a few different things but not reinventing the wheel is just not nearly good enough nowadays somehow. You’ve got to overcommit to one gimmick like most games with overly huge empty worlds and gloomy self-seriousness in order to be more than “Fine” these days. For me? No thanks.

The combat is great, the environments and movement are top tier, even the straightforward story isn’t as bad as some make it sound - it’s mostly a couple specific voice acting performances that are reeeeally bad. I had and am still having a blast playing Atlas Fallen. It has other little flaws but they’ve been repeated ad nauseam. So I’ll just say it’s probably a solid 7.5, maybe an 8 if you love the combat style. It isn’t a 10, but it absolutely isn’t a 2 or whatever, let alone a 0. Plastering “0” scores on things they haven’t experienced or overreacting to one particular thing they don’t like, is something cretins on this site love to do, so even though I don’t like just giving it a 10 to “balance it out”, there’s less than 40 scores right now and I feel I need to help get it closer to reality. I would hesitate buying it at full price only if you’re looking for a AAA package with the production and story at that level. Otherwise, if you want to just shut your brain off and fly around the place with sick traversal and old school PS2/PS3 style God of War-like combat, I say go for it.","Aug 15, 2023",10,"Aug 10, 2023","Rise from the dust and liberate mankind from the oppression of corrupted gods.

ultimate general gettysburg,PC,Pelit (Finland),Critic,"Ultimate General: Gettysburg works surprisingly well as a game, but could use some oomph and chrome, as war is too clinical. [Aug 2015]","Aug 31, 2015",84,,,
ultimate general gettysburg,PC,Calvin_1,User,"This game is one of the best strategy games of all time!

1) It is focused, it concentrates on one battle and does it well, although some may consider it to small, I like the directions they could take this engine to expand it into a more total war esc game.

2) The AI is intelligent and the difficulties are not just eye candy, they are what it is like. Cautious means that they take their time, slow build up using artillery and advancing slowly while aggressive AI will charge your lines, flank you, encircle you and destroy you.

3) You are rewarded for smart play as casualties carry over in the stages, enabling you to in or lose the battle on the first day of fighting.

Admittedly, I am a very long time strategy fan and I will enjoy almost any game that actually improves over time (cough cough total war cough) a definite buy for strategy gamers.","Nov 2, 2015",7.8,,,
ultimate general gettysburg,PC,semperpietas,User,"This is a fun tactical game simulating the American Civil War. It has an easy learning curve, beautiful graphics, complex battlefield AI, and a beautiful art style to represent the largest battle of the American Civil War. Controls are fluid, even if picking exact units is a little troublesome, but the scale and depth is magnificent. Performance is awesome. There are hundreds of scenarios representing different parts of the famous three day battle and the nine AI settings all perform differently and competently. Combat is focused around infantry brigades firing volleys and batteries of artillery that can limber an artillery and the game features a line of sight system for what the player and his units can see. Infantry brigades are rated based on the unit's historical reputation and by a three star rating system (for instance, the famous Confederate Texas Brigade or the Union Irish Brigade are rated with three stars, while less reliable units like some of the Union Eleventh Corps brigades are rated only one star).

There are few historical quirks and rating differences I disagree with though. For instance, Union corps are labelled with Roman numerals, which is an anachronism for the period, and some generals like Richard Ewell of the Confederate 2nd Corps are rated as three stars, when I would argue that his performances would earn him a lower rater. Overall, however, these are minor and I found didn't detract from the gameplay experience.

The only gameplay negatives is that sometimes matches can drag on and there is a timing issue. There is no fast forward button, only pause and play. Pause is useful for micromanaging, but arranging attacks and waiting for units to march across the field can take a long time. If you wish to arrange an intricate assault with a lot of maneuvering, this will often eat into match time. The game is also limited to just the Gettysburg battle, though a future expansion with Antietam is being talked about.

However, these negatives are not overwhelming. By far, Ultimate General Gettysburg is an excellent, light, but intelligent title and recommended for Civil War Buffs and Strategy Fans.","Jun 24, 2015",10,,,

adore,Nintendo Switch,Hey Poor Player,Critic,"At the end of the day, though, that’s not the vision the developers had for Adore and that’s fine, as what they have produced is a damn fine spin on the monster taming genre all the same. Look past the repetition, and you’ll find that early simplicity was a complete red herring, as the complexities of team synergy, hidden passives, and the real-time combat suck you in. The core of what’s here is excellent, and while the narrow scope of the moment-to-moment gameplay loops may feel a little limiting, they allow the excellent core combat and surprising depth to shine through. If, like me, you were a little tired of the genre rehashing the same formula for what feels like forever, then Adore, while not without its flaws, will likely feel like a total breath of fresh air.","Aug 12, 2023",66,"Aug 3, 2023","Draknar, the God of the creatures is losing his power.

double dragon gaiden rise of the dragons,PlayStation 5,Gaming Nexus,Critic,"Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons comes during a time where we wouldn't mind some good ol' fashioned beat 'em up side scrolling games. A huge roster of characters and a great new tag team feature really push the franchise forward. While it gets everything right, it baffles me that we have to wait for online co-op. Still, that shouldn't deter you. Double Dragon fans should grab this right now.","Jul 26, 2023",67,,,

double dragon gaiden rise of the dragons,PlayStation 5,BorgCow,User,"Incredibly fun! A lot to love here, from the retro attitude and light-hearted apocalypse of what the game refers to as New York City. I've also been loving the replay-ability of it, there are just enough roguelike elements to change things up each playthrough, and unlocking the many characters and learning their different move sets has been very satisfying. Game gives you a surprising amount of control over the difficulty- you can make it as easy as you like, but you'll get fewer tokens as a reward, which means taking longer to unlock additional characters and other easter eggs. Can't in good conscious give it a ten as it's missing a few things- namely network multiplayer and maybe a few more cutscenes - I want to see what all the unlockable characters do after saving/conquering the city, even if it's just a single still screen. Wouldn't mind a little more back-and-forth with the bosses as well. The game mechanics are generally great though the super moves are a little too easy to disrupt. That said, this is easily my favorite Double Dragon game, and I've been casually checking in and out of the franchise for decades. I bought it new for $30 on Switch and it's well worth it","Sep 15, 2023",9,,,

Brilliant. The most brilliant puzzle game i have played for decades. Patrick's Parabox constantly challenges you AND blows your mind, and it seems to never stop as the level goes on and on.

The puzzles are well-paced, never too hard or too long to resolve, making it less frustrating than a Baba is You for instance - yet they are amazingly satisfying when you finally solve them.

And from a gameplay standpoint, this is pure videogame. Nothing else than a VIDEO game can give you these perspective, recursive, loop de loop tricks.

synth riders,PlayStation 4,Hey Poor Player,Critic,"I have to admit, it’d been a little while since I last fired up my PlayStation VR. However, now that I’ve experienced Synth Riders, I don’t plan on hanging it up anytime soon. It’s the kind of game you pick up and play for ten minutes and feel totally satisfied, or marathon for a solid hour and get a killer workout while soaking up all the sweet soundscapes. If I have one real complaint, it’s that the game only offers a handful of backgrounds to choose from. Still, with so much going on on-screen, you probably won’t be spending too much time taking in the scenery anyway. Synth Riders is Beat Saber for the VHS generation.

This is an absolutely fantastic rogue-like.  I love that they give you three difficulties, but on top of that, provide other tweaks you can do prior to starting a game to either increase or decrease the difficulty.   THe controls are perfect, although I'd love a way to ""mouse over"" icons such as skills to find out what they do.  That's my only quibble - this is a quality port of an excellent rogue-like with TONS of content, classes, pet raising, items.  Even fans of Diablo that don't mind turn-based approach would enjoy this.  Check out the steam user reviews; 9/10 on average, and I'm giving it a 10 to make up for the lad who bashed the game with clearly little understanding of what a rogue-like is.","Jan 31, 2019",7.7,"Jul 24, 2023","Enter the magical world of Tangledeep, a dungeon crawler inspired by classic 16-bit RPGs.

Jumping around, swinging with your grappling hook and jump from wall to wall doesn't feel clunky or slow. The game allows you to build up momentum and mantain it if you're skilled. The combat is mainly melee-focused, but it offers many special abilities, as well as allowing you to use the grappling hook as a secondary weapon, either for simple ranged damage or to pick up and throw items and stunned enemies at other enemies. Each area has its own gimmicks and traps, and the game allows you to get used to them gradually. The difficulty curve is balanced and each level is a good first level to be played, although, even if it's personal, some levels are slightly easier than some others.

gravity circuit,PC,PikaPhantom,User,"Outstanding game, possibly the best indie game I've ever played. The controls are largely fantastic, and the fast movement makes the game a visceral rush to play. The level design is strong. The presentation is refined, with some really lovely sprite work - despite the game largely adhering to limited color schemes for individual sprites, it's so high quality it leans towards feeling like a 16-bit styled game rather than an 8-bit one. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with a varied lineup of electronic songs (some calm, some very fast-paced). The story is strong as well, with numerous endgame twists that are executed well. While there are some minor gripes I have with elements of the controls and level design, and the game could've used a training room of some kind for experimenting with the new abilities you obtain, they aren't enough to stop me from giving this game a 10/10. There are few things more satisfying in any game than taking advantage of the hookshot grab to throw defeated enemies at others. Genuine shame the game hasn't received more attention, because it could be a genuine contender for Indie Game of the Year. It might even end up being my game of the year overall!","Aug 21, 2023",10,"Jul 13, 2023","In a post-apocalyptic world populated by sentient robots, its inhabitants are once more threatened by an old foe.

As the world's last line of defense, journey through futuristic enemy controlled locales, and take down the evil mastermind behind the chaos.

Reminiscent of classic platformers from the 80s and 90s, with action dialed to maximum, channel your power into your fists and send foes flying, or grapple them to get up close and personal. In your quest you will acquire many new powers, which will allow you to go even further beyond!",https://www.metacritic.com/game/gravity-circuit/

atelier marie remake the alchemist of salburg,Nintendo Switch,Digitally Downloaded,Critic,"Thankfully the colour and humour of Atelier Marie prevent it from becoming dry, despite the clear parallel to real-world work structures. While the jury’s out on how appealing this will be to the Ryza fanbase (in particular), Marie Remake has been an opportunity for me, a hardcore Atelier fan that came to the party in the middle and who loves the “classical” approach to the series, to catch up with the game that started it all. I can see the progression from Marie to Rorona and beyond, and Gust has definitely gotten better at executing the core idea over the years, but even right back then, at the genesis of the series, Atelier has really been the most wholesome comfort food.","Jul 11, 2023",76,,,

the legend of heroes trails into reverie,PlayStation 5,AdoMobA,User,"Pros
- a beautiful epilogue to the first three arcsthe cross-story feature works great to gate story progress in certain points
- the biggest playable cast in the series (51 characters that are fully customizable)
- plethora of post game content that will keep you playing
- the daydreams (reminiscent of the doors from Trails in the Sky the 3rd) give exciting glimpses into the lives of our favorite characters
- the addition of the Abyssal difficulty and the options to increase enemy levels by 50 or 100 allows the gameplay to remain engaging
Cons
- the lack of voice acting makes some of the games more pivotal moments feel way less epic than they could have been
- the controls for Project Tyrfing minigame are god awful

The tenth game in the Trails series is an optionally massive game. From the amount of content, to the story significance and some quite bold directions the story goes, Trails into Reverie takes the training wheels off and relies on you playing all the previous games. And it feels fantastic.
The story is interesting from start to finish, using everything and everyone you met through the Sky, Crossbell and Cold Steel arcs of this series. It also takes some of the previously established concepts and takes them in such a direction that nobody could predict yet it feels right. And the emotional one, two punch that is the ending for the main story left me with a smile on my face and a wash of new excitement for the next arc.
But the main story ending does not mean the game is over. Through the introduction of the Reverie Corridor, you are offered a section of the game mostly focused on the gameplay, offering a plethora of post game content to lose hours to. Gameplay that never gets boring thanks to the introduction of the United Front attacks and the frankly absurd cast hosting 51 characters from all the previous arcs.
Outside of the outstanding Trails combat, the Reverie Corridor also offers previously unseen amounts of minigames and daydreams. All of these offer glimpses into past and future events, giving you an idea of what certain individuals have been up to since their arcs concluded. What is exciting in particular are the two daydreams received in the Post Game, where you are offered a glimpse into the future arc.
All in all, Reverie quickly climbed to be one of my favorite games in the series, owing that fact to its bold story and the sheer amount of characters it lets you play. Reverie not being an entry game allows it to shed some of the burdens of having to reintroduce concepts in each game and allows it to soar to ever greater heights.","Oct 21, 2023",7.9,,,

mundaun,PC,Gamers' Temple,Critic,Mundaun has got an interesting story to tell and it also has multiple endings. There are quite a few secrets to be found for the curious that want to go about exploring its open world. The game clocks in at around 8 hours long for me – probably around 6 hours for most people that don’t get sidetracked too easily. Mundaun is a creative masterpiece of a horror game.

Mundaun will attract its targeted, tiny demographic: those who can see past the dated visuals and lackluster controls. Fortunately, the hand-drawn textures might rope in a few people, and the sepia-esque colors stand out compared to other first-person adventure titles. Mundaun is technologically impotent but makes up for it with excellent atmosphere, sense of place, and storytelling.

It looks, sounds and controls like a current title, and most of the jokes hold up just fine. Not all the gameplay mechanics and mission designs feel that fresh anymore, and it can feel simplistic and repetitive against the backdrop of recent action games.

story of seasons a wonderful life,Nintendo Switch,SeanD,User,"It's a pretty faithful reimagining of an old classic. It adds a few things (more crops, for example) and subtracts others(animal health), but is overall a very enjoyable experience.

While some old HM fans might be disappointed at some of the (very few) omissions, they were clearly mostly done as QoL changes to make the experience less grindy and more streamlined. The main criticism of the game from critics is that it is too slow by 2023 standard, and that is in spite of these changes. So it's understandable why these changes were made in the first place as otherwise the game would feel even slower. But mostly it is a very calm and cozy affair with no glaring flaws to speak of.

However, it is disappointing to see that some with radical extremist views are review-bombing this game with wholly unjustified 0/10 scores simply because it expands on the original by providing more character choices. There's no pandering, no-tokenism, no in-your-face grandstanding show of diversity, nothing is shoved down anybody's throat. It literally just allows people to express themselves in a manner that fits them without substracting anything from anybody else's experience.

Of course, the original game was from a time where minority voices were not given as much importance as they are now, and it seems like some people are just much too 'nostalgic' of those times. Clearly, to the privileged, equality feels like oppression. I worry about the mental and physical health of these 'concerned' individuals and that of their children and other family members as well.

8/10, but gave a 10 anyway to hopefully counteract some of the review-bombing.","Sep 24, 2023",8.0,,,
story of seasons a wonderful life,Nintendo Switch,Undeadbobop,User,"This game deserves far better scores I can not even begin to state what a master peice the orignal was and the added same-sex marriage and non-binary options are only the cherry on top. I looked over the reviews that are negative, they are not worth reading and they do not belong on this site as they go into hate-speech and claim my existence is politics, they are all extremist biggots who would kill me and others like me if given the chance and use their religion and politics to justify it. I am pan and non-binary.  I found the representation to be accurate, a slight alteration on the source material in some parts such as character names, designs, and a slight altering of morning after clear depiction of after sex in the source material was not here, a lot of small translation fixes as the original port studio did a poor job of translating in the original and there was a lot of engrish.  This game left me with dysphoria in the best of ways. I would happily recommend this game over the original as it has improved in literally every way with the small changes they did make and the original was a masterpiece in itself.  The original every farm/date sim tried to capture the lightening from again after and all of them even future Story of Seasons/Harvest moon games just well couldn't for me. This was the best remake **** I have ever seen and I love it. When I heard it was out I threw Friendship of mineral town out of my switch, rushed to the store and bought it while on vacation miles appart from any store. If you want to talk about politics I would love to talk about how in friendship of mineral town pushes so hard on the church. Keep your religion to yourselves I have cookies. In all seriousness friendship of mineral town tried shoving that church down your throats by requiring you to interact with it, in this game you are not required to be non-binary, you are not required to have same-sex marriage, and none of the characters in the main cast are. I do wish one of them was non-binary but I can understand why they didn't take this route. I am allowing my children to play this game after I am done with it. The only scenes censored in it involved after sex scene, so if that is your complaint and your complaint is also about you thinking its a kids game, then those two things don't make any sense.","Jul 25, 2023",10,,,

Bad reviews don’t represent the game, if you’re a fan of metroidvania games, you’l definitely love it.Pros, it’s a very long game, doesn’t feel tedious because you have dozens of equipments and weapons and different combat styles for different weapons. Tons of enemies and each with different drop items, lots of bosses. Cons, the game is that huge that you get stuck pretty often and don’t know where to go. Some abilities of weapons aren’t explained and some definitions that aren’t clear, as well as some quests, the endings could have been more elaborated, it’s so much gameplay for the endings being so… is that all?

final fantasy vi pixel remaster,PC,JimmieRamone,User,"As a fan of this game ever since it first released in North America as Final Fantasy III, I now regard this as the definitive version of the game, with a couple of caveats.

First, it doesn't have the new Espers introduced in the Game Boy Advanced version, or the Dragon's Den bonus dungeon. I personally never felt those additions to be essential to the experience, but players of the GBA version may miss them.

Second, prepare yourself for the Opera House scene. The rearranged orchestra is great, and visually it's never looked better, but.. well, I'm hesitant to provide more details than that, as it felt like it was meant to be a surprise. You will have to take my word for it and judge for yourself when you hear it.

Finally, I highly recommend taking the time to download one of the many mods available to fix the font. There is one available for the SNES version's font that is superb. I only ran into one potential issue, where at a certain part of the game one of the longer dialogue prompt choices was cut off because the default font is quite a bit smaller than the one provided by the mod.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with how this version of my favorite Final Fantasy ended up. The new orchestral arrangements of the songs are excellent, the backgrounds during battles have never looked better, and--with sincere apologies to Ted Woolsey's fans--the localization this time around is absolutely spot on.

final fantasy iii pixel remaster,PC,davygravy93,User,"A very good remaster of Final Fantasy 3, yes it does have some minor flaws but I would still argue that this is the definitive version since it adds some much needed quality of life changes that make the experience much more enjoyable that it was before.

There are a few changes to gameplay the most obvious being the auto battle feature which makes the encounter rate much less of a pain, there's now a run function when not in the overworld, omni directional movement, phoenix downs are much more common, secret passages now have subtle visual clues, and the dungeons now have an optional map you can use.

The visuals are very well done, I know many enjoyed the DS version but I think this pixel remaster is a much more elegant solution than the ds versions big ugly polygons. The sprites, levels, and attack effects have all been remade from the ground up but surprisingly it all meshes together evenly, nothing feels out of place..............well except for one incredibly obvious flaw. The text format. As many others have said the text that is used for dialogue looks horrible compared to everything else and what's worse is that they already use a better text format for damage calculation so there's literally no reason for it to look this bad.

I think it goes without saying that the re orchestrated music sounds fantastic and was my primary reason for buying this game. Nobuo Uematsu oversaw the music and it shows, every track has the level of quality you would expect from his work and in my opinion elevates the atmosphere of FF3 much higher than it was. This is also highly subjective but I think eternal wind is the standout track and possibly the best overworld theme in the entire series.

The story and characters wont blow you away, its a very basic light vs dark story with all the fantasy tropes you would expect **** from the famicom era. That being said the plot gets the job done, it never draws anything out more than it needs to so the pacing is relatively quick in that regard but this has the drawback of never allowing you to get attached to the characters you meet since they pop in and out of the adventure so quickly.

Pros:
+remastered music sounds amazing
+pixelated visuals pays homage to original style but isnt afraid to improve things like the water effects
+auto battle and other QOL changes make playing the game a breeze
Cons:
-terrible looking font looks terrible
-game is incredibly easy with exception of a few bosses","Jul 30, 2021",10,"Apr 19, 2023","When darkness falls and the land is robbed of light, four young heroes are chosen by the crystals to head off an exciting journey across a vast and hostile land.

The gameplay is addictive and you will quickly find yourself getting further and further away from what you initially set out to do, never worried, knowing it will all be worthwhile","Jul 24, 2023",90,,,

8doors arums afterlife adventure,PC,ffmyler,User,"I think that people don't do this game justice.

In the sea of Metroidvania games as of lately, this one really stands out for me!

- It has beautiful art style, hand drawn graphics.
- Nice level of difficulty throughout the game.
- Some bosses are really, really challenging and take time with increase in skill to defeat.
- Controls are tight
- Sound & music is nice, ambiental

Still didn't finish the game, but I am having a really good time playing through it.

Doesn't invent anything new for the genre, but from my perspective and taste, this is Metroidvania done right.

As a comparison, it is much better game than Blasphemous, which has nice art, but the world, lore, and the game itself is generally boring and too much in your face with ""though hath sinned"" kind of vibe. It felt like a grind to just finish the game and never come back to it...","Nov 7, 2021",9,,,

sherlock holmes the awakened,PlayStation 5,Ayumi_Saro,User,"Ця гра відверто не на 10, моя оцінка свідомо не співпадає з реальністю. Реально я б оцінив її на 7-8 балів. Проте мені дуже хочеться звернути увагу й на умови, в яких новий (або ж не зовсім) Шерлок Голмс розроблявся. Розробка почалася вже під час повномасштабного вторгнення в Україну. З моменту початку творці гри перенесли все: від емоційних проблем, пов'язаних з ситуацією навколо, до фізичних, коли банально доводилося підлаштовуватися під графіки відключень світла. І навіть з урахуванням всіх негативних чинників в них вийшла дійсно непогана гра, в якій приємно проводити час, яку не соромно порадити не тільки українцю, а й фанату відеоігор з будь-якої іншої країни.
Я, як українець, просто не маю права ігнорувати проблеми своїх співгромадян в такій важкій ситуації. Та й вважаю несправедливою оцінку, яку гра має зараз.
В цілому, це чудовий продукт, очікування щодо якого не варто завищувати, але й поганим його не назвеш, просто тому що це неправда. Хочеться побажати розробникам успіхів з їхнім наступним проєктом, робота над яким або вже почалася, або почнеться найближчим часом. Сподіваюся він змусить мене поставити 10 балів, не пояснюючи свою позицію, а просто тому що стане витонченим. Я знаю, ви можете це зробити, Фроґи. Дякую вам!","Apr 12, 2023",7.3,,,

a light in the dark,Nintendo Switch,TouchArcade,Critic,I enjoyed my time with A Light in the Dark quite a bit on Nintendo Switch and hope to see more from the world. It is rare for visual novels to feel this grounded and real. Hopefully it gets a physical release in the future.,"May 1, 2023",80,"Apr 5, 2023","Hao-Chen Jiang did not understand what it was when he opened his eyes. Before him was a dim and dreary room that he had not seen before. Trying to get up to turn on the lights, he finds that his arms are tied behind him and that is when he realizes that he's been kidnapped. It is then that a mysterious girl appears before him and with a look of disdain tells him that he's been kidnapped and unless his family agrees to pay a ransom he has no chance to escape. But perhaps there is more to this than just money...

A Light in the Dark is an original visual novel game from the creative minds of CreSpirit (Developers of Rabi-Ribi), Storia (Developers of Dong-jin Rice-hime) and Narrator (Developers of Companion).

The game features a story part and an interactive part where Hao-Chen can examine the items around him as he tries to formulate a plan to escape his kidnappers but beware of your stamina!",https://www.metacritic.com/game/a-light-in-the-dark/

Fun gameplay segments; Great music; Heartfelt story.

Bad-
Love it or hate it art style; Poor lip-synching and wooden animations; Mostly inconsequential decision system.

Thoughts-
This review covers the PS5 version of the game, and it’s worth noting that the framerate didn’t feel entirely smooth. This is of course not super important for an adventure game, but the style of the game paired with the power of the PS5 should have resulted in a smoother experience, which leads me to believe the issue is down to optimization. The strange storybook-style pop-in that appeared in the original Road 96 is also present in Mile 0, though it is less significant.","May 22, 2023",7,,,
grimgrimoire oncemore,Nintendo Switch,Siliconera,Critic,"From the very start, GrimGrimoire was a strong game, and with GrimGrimoire OnceMore VanillaWare made a once niche title even more appealing to a wider audience.

Not to mention the solid strategic elements feel like they flow better with the latest adjustments.

It is addictive and engaging, with a simple yet complex gameplay that allows for human creativity and intelligence in the creation of outposts. As a player, I have enjoyed the game immensely and have spent over 89 hours playing it.

Meet Your Maker is a game that has a lot of potential, and I believe that future updates could improve certain aspects such as the behavior and intelligence of traps, their activation range, the functionality of blocks and weapons. However, despite these minor improvements, the game executes its premise extremely well and is a must-play for anyone looking for an immersive and engaging gaming experience.

Meet Your Maker reminds me of other successful games like No Man's Sky and Cyberpunk, and I can confidently say that it has a bright future ahead of it. The game is not too difficult, but it is not too easy either, and the gameplay ultimately depends on your playstyle.

But a park is not just for people. It's for animals too! Invite scaly, feathered and furry friends to your park and they will make it their home if they like it! Make your park hospitable to animals by adding trees, shrubs, and other natural elements to it. Some curious critters will come to check out your park attracted by certain facilities!

When you start running out of space, grab a pickaxe and make more land usable, also finding various materials in the process. These materials can be used to upgrade your facilities, or even make special items!

There are lots of fun challenges for you to try, too. Nurse saplings until they grow into fine trees, have visitors compete to catch lots of fish, and see if you can hatch various birds and reptiles.

Game looks great, plays great, andreally gives you the ability to take a deep dive in Franchise and enjoy it. I am sure there are some things that can be done in Franchise that makes it more like being a GM of a club, but in terms of Franchise play from all the major sports, this is definitely the deepest and should be the model for EA to look at in terms of giving both Franchise only type players what they want and the money making modes like Diamond Dynasty, HUT, FUT, MUT what they want.

resident evil 4,PlayStation 5,Trusted Reviews,Critic,"Resident Evil 4 Remake not only does right by its original source of inspiration, but it also sets a high bar for what modern day remakes can be. All components of the story have been finetuned into a more well-thought out package, and that’s before mentioning the game’s full use of today’s graphical prowess to deliver a more terrifying interpretation of rural Spain. The core gameplay also retains what made it so great back in the day, but with modern amenities such as a parrying system, quick-select for weapons and the ability to run. And despite the new improvements, the increased aggressiveness of the enemies ensures that the game never feels like a cakewalk. I don’t know who still needs to be convinced at this point, but Resident Evil 4 is a masterpiece that I cannot recommend enough.","Jun 29, 2023",93,"Mar 24, 2023","Resident Evil 4, 2005’s legendary survival horror, is brought fully up-to-date in this ground-up remake.

The horror theme is pretty unplored in the realm of fighting games, so seeing a ""new"" company take the initiative in this field is pretty amazing, besides their first try was not to shabby. Taking everything into consideration as think this is as best as it can get, after they fix all the bugs in the game of course.

not for broadcast,PC,Hardcore Gamer,Critic,"Rarely do you find games these days that could be described as a combination of “ambitious,” “thought-provoking,” “hard-hitting,” “hilarious” and “extremely fun,” but somehow Not For Broadcast delivers on that front.

not for broadcast,PC,GVB,User,"When I decided to buy it I wasn't very convinced. The gameplay seemed original, at least, and it didn't seem like it was going to be too silly... What I found, however, was surprising. In every sense. The story is very well written and manages to mix very emotional moments with others typical of a Monty Python movie, and the game treats you as an adult and intelligent person capable of drawing your own conclusions.

As for what some critics say that there are segments that are too long, I barely remember two or three of those, and I think they put it there intentionally (to explain why would be spoiler). And if you're worried that the game is too difficult, there are several difficulty levels that allow you to just focus on the story.

But if I had to highlight just two things, it would be:

-The decisions, which are interesting to make and have real consequences in the story. This is seen above all in the segments between programs, where, depending on a thousand factors, you can decide in the protagonist's life and in his relationship with his family. And,

-The characters. A 10 to all of them, with special mention to Jeremy Donaldson. Brilliant, like the rest of the game.

So, if you are really looking for something different, mature, fun and exciting, buy it, play it, enjoy it.","Jan 26, 2023",10,"Mar 23, 2023","In an alternate 1980s where the nation stumbles towards dystopia, join the National Nightly News team as they document the latest political scandal, the rise of a radical government, and which celebrity has for some reason written a book about it all.

the guise,PC,Cubed3,Critic,"For a title that is both modestly priced and was also developed by just a small team, The Guise is a valiant attempt at making a Metroidvania-esque title in a gaming world packed with similar efforts. It is a visually striking world that is memorable, with an enjoyable but maybe not so complex fairytale story. While the abilities Ogden can collect do mix things up a bit when it comes to combat, the patterns of enemies make things just a little too simplistic, while at the same time frustrations around the fluidity of controlling Ogden increase that. There is some good fun to be had here, and the boss battles are a highlight among a story that is simple but enjoyable. However, it is possibly not a game likely to stick in the mind over other better executed attempts.","Nov 9, 2020",50,"Mar 17, 2023","""The Guise"" is a dark-fantasy adventure across a big interconnected world that filled with an atmosphere of doom and decay.

alice gear aegis cs concerto of simulatrix,PlayStation 5,Hey Poor Player,Critic,"Alice Gear Aegis CS: Concerto of Simulatrix is welcome return to a genre long thought dead. And though this is still merely the first stepping stone, it’s going in the right direction, it just needs some room to grow and cultivate. The gameplay loop is quick but ever so fierce and memorable in design, and while not every one of the game’s playable Actresses is a star, there are more than enough for just about everyone to be able to sink their teeth into. So if you can forgive the game’s steep learning curve and are looking for the closest thing to Virtual ON to release in recent years, then look no further.

Bien plus long que le précédent, avec des tas d'embranchement mais surtout des personnages à sauver (auront une importance pour la fin), des défis par dizaines bien pensés, et surtout des tas de bonnes idées de gameplay en font un titre incontournable.
Il utilise le eye tracking à la perfection (des ennemis n'agissant que si on cligne des yeux), une ambiance excellente et des niveaux vraiment différents.
Vive le PSVR2 qui n'a jamais aucune perte de localisation (rush of blood finissait toujours par partir en sucette).
Techniquement il est largement plus abouti que son aîné avec des effets de brumes ou des personnages hyper détaillés.
Mes seuls reproches:
1/ les séquences scénaristiques entre les niveaux hyper flous (pas compris pourquoi c'était si moche) et sans grand intérêt
2/ le dernier boss de Rush of blood était bien plus impressionnant et sympa

the sims 4 growing together,PC,Dexerto,Critic,"All in all, while I am not a Simmer that prefers a generational style of play (I typically play with aging turned off and mostly as Young Adults, Adults, or Elders), Growing Together still has plenty of features that appeal to me, from its wide range of catalog items in CAS and Build/Buy through to the gorgeous (albeit shallow-feeling) world of San Sequoia, and an all-new Soul radio station to listen to. If a generational style of play does interest you, however, then The Sims 4 Growing Together will be exactly what you’re looking for. It brings much more (very needed) depth to the systems already in-game, with new likes and dislikes, Milestones, and Family Dynamics fleshing out how your Sims interact with one another. Storytellers will likely have ample fun utilizing all of these new features, and it has to be said that removing these gameplay elements would take a lot away from how individual Sims are now starting to feel all these years after its original 2014 release.","Mar 19, 2023",82,,,

anno 1800 console edition,PlayStation 5,Digitally Downloaded,Critic,"Anno’s core strength is the cities that it allows you to create. Sometimes it does feel more like a puzzle game than a simulator, as you desperately try to figure out how to give your most demanding residents access to everything they crave. However, the satisfaction of doing it well is almost incomparable for the genre. I am a firm believer that simulation games, at their best, teach you about real-world jobs, processes, and social/cultural/environmental dynamics, whether that be flying a plane, driving a train, running a hotel or building a city. Anno does that, and it presents players with a vision for cities that will, hopefully, be the future of urban planning.","Mar 22, 2023",83,"Mar 16, 2023","Welcome to the 19th century, a time of industrialization, diplomacy, and discovery.

I'm still learning all of the games many management functions and tricks for success, as it becomes pretty difficult fairly into a new run to keep up with if you make mistakes. I do wish some of the paid DLC skin packs were included into the base game, I'm not upset that there's cosmetic DLC to purchase but the vanilla game should have come with more options for buildings still. The music is simply beautiful and the graphics are amazing for a city builder sim game. Control wise it can be a little quirky as the game was obviously designed for mouse and keyboard, but they did a good job making it work well enough on console. I can't comment on how fun the multiplayer is because I've sat in matchmaking for over 5 minutes several times and gave up, but it's a pretty niche game for console players so I expected that. Overall the game is probably an ""8"" for me so far, but giving it a ""10"" because anyone giving the game a ""0"" just because they apparently had to use an email to play the free demo is simply a ridiculous thing to trash a game over in 2023.

clash artifacts of chaos,PC,Softpedia,Critic,"Clash: Artifacts of Chaos is an interesting mix of ideas, most of them familiar, with some unique twists. The hand-to-hand combat focus is good, although it takes a lot of experimentation to do everything right. The world is intriguing and surprising, especially when it comes to character and enemy design. This is a hard game and any sentient enemy can become a big problem fast. But the biggest issue with the game is how confusing it can be to move through the world, especially when doubling back through already known areas. Clash: Artifacts of Chaos rewards patience and quick reflexes and shows how being extra weird can make a game memorable.","Mar 14, 2023",69,,,
clash artifacts of chaos,PC,New Game Network,Critic,"Clash: Artifacts of Chaos offers a beautiful new rendition of Zenozoik with suitable fisticuffs against whacky creatures, offset by awfully circuitous traversal and repetitive gameplay.","Mar 14, 2023",72,,,
clash artifacts of chaos,PC,OnurK,User,"As a Zeno Clash lover at first I was sceptical when this game came out. The art style was completely different and the game did not feel surreal as it was in the first two game. But the more I played the more I started thinking  that this game is much much better, of course Zeno Clash series and this game has their own uniqueness and they are good in their own way. But this game is a level up. I've known ACE Team since my childhood, Zeno Clash was my first introduction of their work. I've never thought that there would be another game of Zeno and seeing this game makes me happy.

Gameplay and other technicalities:
- Combat is definitely different than one Zeno has but this doesn't mean it is bad. The combat was really enjoyable because of the smoothness and variations of combos. Dd not feel repetitive at all. The cartoonish sound effects didn't feel right at first but it is actually fitting to the new style and is fun.

Story and other designs:
-The story is quite touching, it gets you more emotional the more you hear about the characters, you feel connected to the characters very quickly. Map design is top notch work and the colors are magnificent. I don't remember how many times I have stopped to watch the view and inspect the details. The dialogues weren't perfect as it was a bit lacking in depth, the characters stay very flat when their story telling ends shortly but the voice acting is just perfect especially for main character Pseudo. Pseudo's design and voicing couldn't be more perfect, his voice fits the character like a glove.

Music:
-My favorite of this game is... the AMAZING music! Even most of the AAA games can't get it right. Patricio Meneses is a legend for this. Sometimes the melodies sooth you and tell you stories and sometimes amazes you and gives you chills with it's epicness. The whole album is gonna be on my list to listen to. Words aren't enough to describe the music. Masterpiece!

Issues of the game in case developers read:
1 - The game doesn't tell you what exactly the night body sequence is, who are they? What are they? I would say it doesn't make any sense, but we don't even have any information about them besides The Boy's explanation towards the end of the game. I was a little disappointed at the end when I learnt nothing about it.
2 - Cutscenes sometimes feel lacking due to some reasons: Low ambiance support, weak and short dialogue.
3 - Sometimes the music doesn't play for several minutes and you are being left with empty running/walking. I'm guessing its a bug, it wasn't a big deal but it was definitely noticable.
4 - The UI is a little weak and bland. You can't save recipies, you have to keep trying combinations to get it right which leads to loss of ingredients. You can't access stat information through inventory (only possible at the camp feature)","Sep 7, 2023",6.7,,,
clash artifacts of chaos,PC,GandalfCzarny,User,"This is a game that will have so many followers as much as opponents. Personally I really like this game - I love this wacky and surreal world, because it's nothing I saw before in any other game (except ZC 1 and ZC2). I really like Pseudo and the Boy as main characters and their relationship. Also I think that combat system is really, really great because it's simple to play but hard to master, and it have this stiffness that is sometimes need in a games. Overall I think that this is very good game, but I can't recommend it for everyone. But if you like other ACE Team works then this one is definitely for you","Mar 18, 2023",8,,,

We can’t forget those that may need a break from all the heavy AAA titles on the Xbox Store too, as they should be open to looking at this relatively inexpensive game that is a nice break from the normal. Go ahead, shoot some terrorists in a setting that should bring a smile or two to your face as you play.","Jun 1, 2023",70,,,

fatal frame mask of the lunar eclipse,PlayStation 5,GameforGamers,User,"Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is an amazing horror game that I can't recommend enough. The story is full of mystery and suspense, and the graphics are incredibly detailed and atmospheric. You play as one of three protagonists, each with their own unique abilities, as you explore the eerie and dangerous environment of a cursed Japanese village. The game features haunting music and sound effects, as well as incredibly disturbing monster designs. Combat is intense and requires strategy, as you must use your Camera Obscura to capture the souls of the malevolent spirits that lurk in the shadows. The puzzles are also challenging, but rewarding when solved. Overall, Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is an unforgettable horror experience that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a good scare.","Apr 16, 2023",7.7,,,

This is a tall order with how amazing expansions like The Taken King, Forsaken, and The Witch Queen have been. Nevertheless, Lightfall has surpassed my expectations in almost every way. The gameplay is even more fun and fluid, the location is fresh and new, and while the story has holes, I'm excited to learn how Bungie fills them over the following year and on.

If you have any interest in superb level design, excellent storytelling, terrific art, evocative music, great characters, hilarious situations and emotional gut-punches, Horace is a no-brainer. It's moving without being manipulative, clever without being smug, and nostalgic without being a lazy rehash. So yes, Horace is another indie masterpiece, and every gamer who enjoys quality experiences should play it; a masterpiece that owes so much to its medium, but has the strength, creativity and identity to stand alone as something very, very special.

horace,Nintendo Switch,mabster,User,"I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I've passed it by a number of times, and glad I finally picked it up during a sale. The game is definitely worth it's full price.

The gameplay is a platformer where the ""gimmick"" is that the robot can walk along the walls and ceiling. When oriented on a wall, for example, gravity will act toward the wall. At first this is quite disorienting but you get used to it. It makes for some interesting level design, with the designers using the orientation to great effect. It's similar to Super Mario galaxy in terms of gravity shifting, but plays quite differently because gravity tends to act at 90 degree increments.

I found the story very heartwarming. The robot protagonist is almost child-like. The robot will not quite understand the adult things happening around him. The story is very British and I chuckled a number of times at the humour. The ""voice acting"" is all narrated by the robot with a varying pitch English robot voice. The supporting characters were all quite different and memorable. I really enjoyed the ending, it was a great wrap up to the story.

The game was quite expansive. It is a Metroidvania game (with addition abilities and backtracking), linear in story (divided into chapters).","Sep 3, 2021",10,"Feb 28, 2023","This masterpiece from Paul Helman and Sean Scapelhorn is a classic platformer that tells an emotional and surprisingly rich tale of self-discovery peppered with nostalgic popular culture references that will bring a smile to any gamer who enjoys the 8 and 16 bit era!

catan console edition,PlayStation 5,Gamers' Temple,Critic,"Overall, I’d say that this is a good video game adaptation of a board game – the AI is competent enough to be challenging to average player, but not so strong as to be frustrating, and the graphics put the original cardboard and plastic game to shame visually. I wish there was more information on the rules and even gameplay tips, though, as well as more gameplay customization options. CATAN: Console Edition won’t replace sitting around a board with friends, but it’s a good enough option if you want to learn the game or just take a board game break when you can’t round-up your friends for a game night.","Apr 6, 2023",65,,,
catan console edition,PlayStation 5,Digitally Downloaded,Critic,"Catan – Console Edition is a perfectly fine adaptation of a hugely popular board game. The developers have done their best to make it work for both online and offline play, and present it gorgeously. I just wish that another, equally talented developer, took Twilight Struggle, or the Game of Thrones board game, or any of a few hundred other incredible board games and adapted those instead.","Mar 13, 2023",70,,,

blood bowl iii,PC,GamingTrend,Critic,"The game is rather complex, with plenty of ins and outs to uncover and learn. It is undoubtedly challenging for newbies and can be overwhelming at first. However, you will eventually figure it out if you give the game a chance and don't get discouraged immediately. Once you get the gist of it, matches are engaging and gratifying, and you will be compelled to play over and over again.Blood Bowl 3 is not yet another turn-based RPG or rogue-like deck-building game. It is a rare mix of turn-based fantasy strategy and sports that requires relentless dedication. However, its significant emphasis on turn-based strategy, its fantasy theme, its Warhammer setting, and its extensive use of gore and violence may intrigue gamers who may not enjoy sports games at first but love tabletop-inspired games. Whatever the case, Blood Bowl 3 is worth trying; you may discover a rich, thrilling game that stands out with its bloodlust.","Apr 30, 2023",57,"Feb 23, 2023","Brutal, crazy, tactical... this is BLOOD BOWL!

blood bowl iii,PC,fast-foodeur,User,"Bon déjà pour commencer j'adore ce jeu! Je l'attendais avec impatience et enfin il est arrivé, oui même après plusieurs reports qui devenait de plus en plus inquiétant pour le développement, je ne baissait pas les bras et me dire qu'on allait bientôt pouvoir y mettre les mains dessus et c'est le cas! Bon pour commencer le jeu nous offre une grosse campagne bien garnie que malheureusement je n'ai jouer seulement peu de temps, mais qui a l'air assez complet et plutôt riche pour un jeu de ce genre et qui en plus est beaucoup, énormément, extrêmement et j'en passe des adjectifs plus poussé que blood bowl 2 mais pour le moment de ce que je constate la campagne pourrait durer presque une petite dizaine d'heures ce qui n'est pas négligeable comparé a blood bowl 2 que elle ne durait que quelques heures dans mes souvenirs. Les graphismes, j'adore les graphismes de ce jeu ils sont presque à couper le souffle oui certes c'est pas réaliste comme blood bowl 2 mais c'est plus cartoon, plus vibrant et plus coloré ce qui me donne toujours plus envie de garder l'oeil à l'écran mais je sait que il y a une partie qui préfère le côté plus réaliste de blood bowl 2 mais bon il faut au moins plaires à d'autres personnes. La customisation nous promet d'être énorme à partir de la saison 1 et les saisons futures et année futures pour l'instant la customisation est très limitée comme par exemple pour l'instant nous avons seulement droit à 1 Cheerleaders ou 3 coachs ce qui n'est pas énorme pour l'instant je vous l'accorde mais tout la customisation va grandir grâce au passe de combat qui s'appelle le malepierre qui j'imagine va coûter plus de 10$ et qui va faire grincer des dents je n'en doute même pas car si vous n'achetez pas le passe de combat vous allez rester très limitée dans votre customisation du personnage, Cheerleaders, coachs, terrains, tribune etc.... Pour ce qui est de l'IA je l'avoue elle est nul mais vraiment trop nul et je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs, Cyanide nous avait promis une IA améliorée et intelligente qui serait meilleur que blood bowl 2 mais elle est franchement , elle fait de la , dans une partie que c'est à en mourir de rire, à voir si ils vont l'améliorer, dans mon scénario je pense qu'ils vont essayer de l'améliorer a travers des mise à jour mais qui ne sera jamais abouti à avoir une bonne IA, et dans mon cas à moi je m'en fous un peu de l'IA car je joue seulement avec en mode campagne et de temps en temps dans le mode ligue pour m'améliorer un peu car je préfère largement jouer avec un vrai joueur mais je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs solo en ligue. Du côté de la bande sonore c'est un délice pour mes oreilles les sons sont excellents musique très bonne et bande sonore très agréable rien à redire dessus. Encore une fois je comprends la déception des joueurs car la plupart des options quasi obligatoire pour jouer comme par exemple mettre sur pause quand on joue en ligne dans le mode ligue qui va seulement arriver à la saison 2 de l'année 1 je peux comprendre le mécontentement qui devrait y être déjà disponible à la sortie du jeu. Pour conclure c'est mon préféré blood bowl largement meilleur que le 2 selon moi avec du contenu qui devrait sortir sur le jeu pour encore plusieurs et plusieurs années ce qui fait que le jeu sera encore plus supporté et mis à jour que blood bowl 2 est une bonne nouvelle selon moi et qui permet aussi à de nouveaux joueurs de pouvoir embarqué dans cet univers car oui lui au moins permets aux nouveaux joueurs de bien pouvoir apprendre et être moins perdu que les anciens blood bowl qui était moins friendly. Et oui encore une fois je comprends la grosse déception des joueurs mais je crois au moins fermement que la plupart des trucs que les gens grognent vont être réglés et oui blood bowl 2 aussi n'était pas parfait à sortie donc je crois vraiment qu'on devrait lui accorder un peu de temps et de chances car je crois vraiment qu'il a un énorme potentiel. Donc oui foncez le prendre, au prix qu'il coûte je crois pas qu'il vaut la peine d'attendre une promotion pour ceux qu'il veulent l'essayer donc je vous dis bon blood bowl et c'est l'heure du match!!!","Feb 23, 2023",1.6,"Feb 23, 2023","Brutal, crazy, tactical... this is BLOOD BOWL!

the light brigade,PlayStation 5,fwejio4kl,User,"Title: **A Refreshing, Engaging VR Experience**

Score: **9/10**

""Light Brigade"" is a game that truly shines in the realm of VR. After spending over 50 hours immersed in its compelling world and conquering the final boss on the highest difficulty level, I can confidently say that this title is well worth your time.

The game's ambiance stands out, enveloping players in a world that is both thrilling and beautifully rendered. Every class offers its unique advantages, adding depth and diversity to the gameplay experience. The controls are responsive, ensuring an effortless and enjoyable interaction with the virtual world.

One of the standout features of the game is its replayability. The pursuit of leveling up all the classes keeps you coming back, making every new run feel fresh and challenging.

However, the game is not without its shortcomings. Despite playing at the highest difficulty, I found that it was too easy to stay covered and use the magic wand to eliminate enemies from a safe distance. I would have appreciated a more aggressive AI that could actively seek to flush me out from cover.

Another minor issue is with the game's economy. In the daily runs, I often found gold keys with no apparent use. Similarly, after leveling up sufficiently, I ended up accumulating a surplus of coins with no way to spend them. It would be great to see more avenues to utilize these resources in future updates or iterations of the game.

Despite these minor flaws, ""Light Brigade"" is an exceptional VR experience that I highly recommend. Its engaging gameplay, unique class system, and impressive ambiance make it a standout title in the PSVR2 lineup.","May 21, 2023",7.5,"Feb 22, 2023","The world lies in ruins and with each passing day the light grows dimmer.

In PS VR2, you catch fireworks by aiming at them and pulling the trigger, and shoot them with the Circle button. In addition to the single-player mode, a replay mode is also available. You can change the camera’s viewpoint for incredible replays, stop time to enjoy the show, add different effects, and more.

It's so good that the only issue is that it's too short.

kayak vr mirage,PlayStation 5,TheDuality,User,"What hooked me on this game was that it dropped me straight into a swimming pool, in a kayak, and let me paddle around. No immediate menus or tutorials, just an immediate ""wow, cool!"" moment.

Graphics look incredible on the PSVR2, and just paddling up to some rocks and then pushing yourself away with the end of the paddle feels so weirdly real that I can't really describe it.

Highly recommend using a mop (with the head removed of course) or something similar and some zip-ties for the full experience!

So far I am having a lot of fun using it as a nice break from some of the more intense VR games, it is a lot of fun for me just to paddle around and enjoy some scenery.","Apr 2, 2023",5.1,,,
kayak vr mirage,PlayStation 5,Houndstar,User,"If I was to review this as a game I would probably give it a 3 perhaps 4 as it is very limited as to content but that would not do this title justice. To review it as an experience, which it is what it essentially is, I have to say that this is one of the best, if not the best I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy in virtual reality.
As well as being brilliantly immersive, the graphics are among the best I have ever seen on any headset I have tried and testament to the expertise and passion that the developers have put in to creating this masterpiece.
There is nothing to compare it to on my Xbox Series X for obvious reasons but, to my surprise, I actually prefer the PSVR2 to my Oculus Quest 2 even when tethered to my 3090 PC, it is just that good. I would say the graphics are on par with the PC but look even better on the oled screens that the PS5 version has available.
I must admit that I did experience a fair bit of nausea initially with this title but, after playing around with the accessibility options, I have found a nice comfort level and don't get such issues anymore so well worth experimenting with if you experience similar discomfort.
I would not hesitate to recommend this title and would go as far as to say that every PSVR2 owner should buy it. Fantastic.","Feb 22, 2023",8,,,

And when it comes to replay value, the game’s loot and upgrade systems will keep you coming back for more as you work to craft the ultimate arsenal of zombie-killing hardware. Still, I can’t help but wish the game had just a little bit more to offer players out of the gate. Depending on which difficulty you choose, you can barrel through its five stages in just a few hours. And with just a handful of zombie types to encounter, things can start to feel a little repetitive after a while. Still, if you’re looking for Left 4 Dead-style thrills on your favorite headset, After The Fall is as close as you’re going to get, and a solid addition to any VR gamer’s library.","Dec 16, 2021",80,"Feb 22, 2023","From the creators of Arizona Sunshine comes an epic VR action FPS with intense co-op gameplay at its core that pits up to 4 players against a post-apocalyptic VR world filled with ferocious undead, mutated and twisted by the relentless cold.

after the fall,PC,Ch0ppy,User,"Even though you need a decent PC for this game, it is really good game! So much fun and thrill at the same time. I have seen people say its Left 4 Dead 2 but in VR. From a guy who has played L4D2 for years honestly that comparison is inaccurate considering you can't play as zombies as far as i can tell in this game (what i think is Left 4 dead/2 biggest differenciator) This game with its guns and general vibe for me feels way more like Killing floor 2.

mecho tales,Nintendo Switch,Formula,User,"Mecho Tales is an exercise in frustration, confusion, and ultimately disappointment. The character design is mildly interesting, and the soundtrack is occasionally passable, but beyond that the game is simply not enjoyable. The concept of firing from a drone is somewhat unique, but the implementation is terrible and you never really feel connected to your character. The game has the illusion of fast paced combat - screens filled with projectiles - but more often then not you're just sitting still and directing your shots, waiting for the target to blow up. it's even worse when you're trying to play with two or more players, since you'll frequently find that only one person will be visible on the screen, or you get caught screen-scolling back and forth between areas like an old 8-bit game. The game is not expensive, and younger children who don't know any better may be distracted enough by the bright visuals to not realize they're playing a really poorly implemented action platformer, but you're probably better off saving your pennies for a better game.","Dec 30, 2019",2,"Feb 17, 2023","An all-new adventure in the world of Mecho Wars!

The premium pass is a good idea as a way to experience most of the tables that Pinball FX has to offer if you are okay not owning the tables once the subscription is up. Otherwise I’m happy with what I’ve played. It’s been fun to get a few rounds in each day and tackle the events to experience tables I otherwise might skip over.

clockwork aquario,Nintendo Switch,Nintendo Life,Critic,"Clockwork Aquario has been a long time coming, but it was definitely worth the wait. An obvious labour of love, this ill-fated arcade gem has been improbably recovered, restored, and reassembled, and it never feels like anything less than a carefully unearthed treasure that’s been polished until it shines. It won’t take long to beat — and it shouldn’t, because a good 30-year-old arcade platformer is supposed to be short and sweet — but what the game lacks in length it more than makes up for in entertainment and raw creativity, with stages pitting you against everything from mechanical flying fish to a gigantic egg-dropping robo-penguin. It’s the sort of game you come back to again and again because you want to rather than have to, and we feel lucky to have it.","Nov 29, 2021",70,"Feb 15, 2023",,https://www.metacritic.com/game/clockwork-aquario/

wanted dead,PC,GameSpace,Critic,A genuinely gleeful throw back to a time when gaming was jsut starting to bring the best of out the fifth and sixth generation console era.

wanted dead,PC,IGN France,Critic,"Nice try. Wanted: Dead disappoints in every aspect, and it’s heartbreaking. You can see there’s an amazing game right there. But the gameplay is not precise enough to be fun. The game doesn’t have the time to tell the story of its goofball characters: it’s so short you’ll feel it hasn’t really started when you’re done with it.","Feb 13, 2023",60,,,
wanted dead,PC,tim_cusack08,User,"Wanted:Dead is a very fun throwback action title but it comes with fundamental design flaws like a goth kid in school trying to look normal among his peers. Wanted:Dead is a not a normal game, not by a long shot. Very recently I played Valkyrie Elysium made by the same developer and both games feel very similar in terms of blandness. Valkyrie Elysium is a conservative RPG with good story and decent gameplay but it falls flat when creativity comes into play. There’s no creativity In Valkyrie Elysium, it feels tamed, most likely restricted by Square Enix. Like many other Square Enix titles these days, Valkyrie takes no chances and therefore loses its ability to wow.

Wanted:Dead tries hard to be normal and very boring and stay in its lane but occasionally pulls the leash and delivers insane amounts of creatively satisfying content. The story is barely there and it’s very hard to follow and I was bored by the cutscenes until suddenly some artistic spark started coming out of the scenes at the cantina or the scene at the noodle bar. These moments make the game shine bright with charm and personality. Insane executions while wearing cat ears, face smudged in blood and then a quick smoke if you leave the controller idle. Real joy mixed with anger from the final mission that drags on forever.

As a note I want to add that this game deserves way more love that it gets. Wanted:Dead is far from mediocre and this game has balls to be different in the day and age when all games are standardised and measured to feel exactly the same.

wanted dead,PC,saulter,User,"About time we talk Wanted: Dead here. Truth to be told I created this account to talk about Wanted: Dead. I never post reviews online. Never, ever. This is the first time I will openly talk about a game that left an impression on me. This is probably what bipolar disorder feels like. I have been psychologically molested by Soleil and 110 Industries and it was one of the most memorable and amazing experiences in games I had in the past 5 years. Sometimes a game comes along and you buy it because of the cover art. This is how I did it. I have never seen a pink cover art on an action game before in my life. Nobody did. This is new. I come home and I start playing. My first impression is very bad. I don’t understand any of this and the game is brutally hard. First mission, I’m still not sold on it but I keep playing because I don’t know why. Usually I just toss the game if it ****. Wanted: Dead didn’t **** at all but I just couldn’t get it. I stopped playing a lot of games mid way because they are boring. I’m looking at you God of War Ragnarok. Wanted: Dead has a fraction of GoW’s production values but somehow it keeps you entertained. Then I spent two hours picking toys in a crane game. Yes, I’m still talking about Wanted: Dead. Then I reached August and I felt like I was going to quit but when I finally kicked his ass it was a scream of joy. My GF ran into the living room to see what’s up. Then you are treated to a karaoke sequence that is real karaoke. Do you remember Just a Friend bit from Saints Row? This is exactly it but playable. Then Space Runaway. It’s an actual 16-bit SHMUP. Not a level or something. An actual arcade game was made for Wanted: Dead and when I unlocked it, I spent hours trying to beat it. Wanted: Dead surprises you every minute. The combat really opens up on the second mission when you progress further down the skill tree. The executions are gory and fun. There’s also a chainsaw. This game is a collection of randomized chaotic ideas all put together. It should not work but somehow it does and it’s a lot of fun. I’m on my second play through now.

ten dates,PC,Softpedia,Critic,"Ten Dates is a very classic full-motion video experience. It has a clear theme and manages to make the dating elements, especially for the initial speedy encounters, feel fleshed out. There are some interactions that feel forced and a few changes of tone that miss the mark. But this is a competent romantic narrative with light gameplay. The game wisely allows players to skip the sequences they have already seen, which makes it easy to explore most if not all the story branches.

boyfriend dungeon,Nintendo Switch,TheLinkgirl,User,"At a time where roguelites are becoming increasingly tiresome due to their inherent lack of design, it's fair to say that the best roguelites are the ones that circumvent that shortcoming, commonly by injecting another genre into the formula. As rhythm games, card games and Metroidvanias have become almost overused, one clever developer thought **** idea: a dating game.

Inclusivity is certainly the name of the game with Boyfriend Dungeon, allowing for relationships to be as intimate as you'd like. Some characters are non-binary, and the game allows you to date as you want to; polyamory is totally allowed, but you don't have to. Gameplay bounces between two simple ideas, one where the player goes on dates, and one where the player dives into simple combat in simple dungeons. While both ideas are perfectly fine in their own right, it's the combination of the two that makes Boyfriend Dungeon work so well, with dates unlocking new abilities for weapons in combat, and combat unlocking dates.

While there isn't a massive amount of content, I feel Boyfriend Dungeon has the perfect amount for a playthrough and then some. It was totally worth it for me just to experience all the characters in the way I wanted to.","Sep 5, 2022",6.5,"Feb 14, 2023",Romance your swords!

boyfriend dungeon,Nintendo Switch,Mando44646,User,"This is one of my favorite games this year. I'm also a proud backer of it on Kickstarter.

The characters are fun and decently developed, the dungeon gameplay is a lot of fun (similar-ish to Hades'), and the story is good enough to rely on fun character interactions. It also fills a niche that doesn't really exist - a bisexual dating sim.

The game is short though and I wish there were more than 2 dungeons, because I enjoyed playing them so much.

At the moment it’s a no-brainer - don’t dare play this. Wait and see if 8floor address the issue.","Aug 27, 2023",30,,,

The art has a unique and striking style, but the rest of the presentation is quite weak. It’s a mildly amusing game to poke at, but it could have been a lot better.","Jan 30, 2023",60,,,

The amount of games and extra editions help to make this the definitive Wonder Boy Collection. The minor control issues and changes are a bit disappointing, but a few patches could be applied to fix these. It does retain the original collections very bland presentation and menu system, so it tends to feel more like a DLC add-on than a whole new collection. However it’s a vast improvement over the previous one. If you own the original release, you owe it to yourself to delete that one and pick this one up. If you skipped the first one, then this is the one that you need to get.

BECAUSE the STORY, the characters, the quests, the items, magic, the worlds, the difficulty in battle, ARE AT THEIR BEST !!! no game can beat that. Risen 1 is a game like no other.

its the only game that i feel im really living in that world. i played 30 hours without sleep the first time i played. Try it for yourself, its really better than any other rpg if you have patience.

i played both the PC and xbox 360 version. the xbox 360 version is not beautiful VS PC, but its still the same game.

risen,Xbox 360,quickster6243,User,"Just played through this is around 45 hours.

Pros: Game is challenging, but not too hard. I felt it was just right. There isn't too much hand holding. The game encourages exploration. It's very quest driven. You can literally spend like 5 hours in a city doing all the quests, looting all the houses, finding all the secrets. The island is very large and you can spend a good amount of time just mowing down enemies.

Cons: Graphics are horrible. A lot of the game is pointless. There is very little reward in exploration. You can get most of your top tier jewelery crafted by the 2nd chapter. There isn't very many sets of armor. The stat system is very bland and simplistic. The worst things about this game are the bugs and there are MANY!

This game is much better on the PC. It plays better and the graphics are much better. So if you have the option, then pick this up for your PC instead.","Oct 1, 2014",7,"Jan 24, 2023","An epic story in an authentic world hand-crafted with an eye for detail and populated by ""real"", plausible characters.

world war z aftermath,PC,P10tr3k,User,"It's been a long time since I had so much fun playing a game.  Recently I had so much fun playing Dead By Daylight about 2 years ago.  This game rocks and I want to come back to it all the time.  So far I'm only playing the campaign, with one friend + two bots.  Bots can be disabled in private network mode.  The campaign is great.  Each act is divided into several episodes.  Beautiful landscapes and polished maps.  Incredibly huge hordes of zombies to kill.  Even bigger than those in Days Gone.  And this climate.  And what's really cool is the lot of randomness in the game.  Sometimes you have to approach the episode several times because it is difficult (we play on level 3 of difficulty 5 - at the beginning I recommend playing on level 1, even if you have already played some FPS), but thanks to the randomness, each episode can surprise you every time.  Highly recommend! Fantastic game. P.S.  By default, private network mode uses an external server.  I recommend enabling the local server option (less ping in my case).","Jan 12, 2022",6.0,,,

river city girls 2,Nintendo Switch,Promotheus,User,"I thought the first game was awesome and a breath of fresh air. I’m not a big beat ’em up-fan, but RCG reinvented the genre and made it much less repetitive.

Part Deux as it were is more than anything more of the same, which is fine. I feel generally that the quality is less inspired than in the first one over the board. The biggest problems are the much lower framerate and the long loading times. Going from a smooth 60 fps to 30 is a considerable downgrade. I can’t for the life of me understand why this was done though, this is a pixel art game, same goes for the loading times. I seriously doubt this is something a patch can fix. Highly suspect it’s poor optimization which would be tied to the source code.

Here are some other improvements I’d like to see:

* A reworked map. You have to look at the map a lot, there really should be a mini map on the HUD. And often the map does not correspond to how the game works. There will be an exit to the side when it’s actually on top etc.

* A cancel button. When doing the ”combos” by repeatedly pressing punch, you can often tell that you are going to get hit long before it happens.

I loved the music in the first game and listened to it long after I had stopped playing the game. There is nothing wrong with the music in RCG 2, but it doesn’t have the banger factor that the first one had.

It’s nice with new characters, but I would’ve liked at least one more womanly character. The ones we got now are both butch. Bosses are fine but they are more about dodging and getting your pot shots in, than a straight up fist fight. If you liked the first one definitely check RCG 2 out.","Dec 20, 2022",7,"Dec 15, 2022","The River City Girls are ready for round 2!

beholder 3,PC,Movies Games and Tech,Critic,"Beholder 3 takes the best bits of the first two games in this series and blends them together to make a fun, dark, morally challenging point-and-click adventure. While slow in pace is still thoroughly enjoyable. If you like dystopian fiction, if you like puzzle-based point-and-click adventures, if you like strong narrative then Beholder 3 might just be the game for you. It’s one I will be playing again and again.","Mar 26, 2022",67.0,"Dec 15, 2022","A totalitarian state that controls everything and everyone through oppressive laws, total surveillance, and intimidation.

You are Frank Schwarz, a husband, and father who lost his cushy office job at the Ministry after someone set him up. The only way to avoid jail time was to make a deal with a high-ranking security officer.

Now a government spy working undercover as a landlord, you must break into tenants' apartments, search them for contraband and eliminate anyone your boss wants out of the picture.

At the same time, you'll have to spy and scheme against co-workers and superiors in the Ministry to work your way back up the ladder. Different factions are secretly vying for power over the Ministry and the country play them against each other to your advantage.

Can you get your old life back, or even something better? Will you fight for change and truth or uphold the status quo? Who are you willing to sacrifice to get what you want?",https://www.metacritic.com/game/beholder-3/

beholder 3,PC,Jt0429,User,"Good-
The game feels very high-stakes and intense. The choice and consequences are mechanic is well thought out.

Bad-
Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. Dialogue is so bland and has no soul. Gameplay design is so tedious and just not fun

Thoughts-
Beholder 3 takes all that worked in Alawar’s previous Beholder games, and coalesces them into a neat little package that doesn’t shy from going into dark spaces with its political drama and depiction of a totalitarian state. Its choice and consequence mechanics work really well in tandem with its constantly high-stakes gameplay. However, many of these ideas get dragged down by bland design and dialogue, and loads of technical inefficiencies. Beholder 3 might not appeal to everyone, but the bottom line is this – if you liked Beholder and Beholder 2, you will probably end up liking this one as well.","Mar 4, 2022",6.0,"Dec 15, 2022","A totalitarian state that controls everything and everyone through oppressive laws, total surveillance, and intimidation.

grime,PC,NME,Critic,"GRIME is such a consistently astounding game that it’s hard to believe it didn’t just fall out of the sky fully formed. The world it’s set in is one of the most compelling in recent memory, the combat is weighty, satisfying, and incredibly difficult, and the ecstatic feeling you get upon conquering some of the bigger challenges rivals the same feeling you get in a Dark Souls game.","Aug 1, 2021",81.0,"Dec 15, 2022","An unusual material collapses in on itself, the world shudders and contracts, and suddenly you are squeezed into existence.

What awaits you is a world unknown, alien in its own familiarity, and you must survive what terrors you face. Explore your surreal surroundings, absorb the many enemies you encounter, and use their own traits against them as you let yourself become far more than you once were.
