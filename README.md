# 🫧 Word Bubble 🫧 Sentiment Analysis Project 📈 - Team 3dPy 🎮

## Overview 📝

This repository contains the work of Team 3dPy, for the Sony PlayStation Hackathon. Our project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on PlayStation blog posts and social media content surrounding game launches. The data used in this project is publicly available and generally complies with all relevant web scraping guidelines and robots.txt files. Also, this was fun 😄. Not breaking any laws here 🚓

### Project Objective 🎯

To conduct a word bubble sentiment analysis of public posts and comments from various social media sites. This analysis centers around PlayStation game launches, providing insights into public sentiment and engagement. We use the natural language toolkit (NLTK) to perform sentiment analysis on the data. The results are then visualized using D3.js and Domo. 

### Data Collection 📊

The data for this project was collected from the following sources:

- PlayStation Blog 🟢
- Twitter 🔴 
- Facebook 🔴
- Reddit 🟢
- Instagram 🔴
- Metacritic 🟢
- IGN 🟡
- Gamespot 🟡


**Notes:** *We didn't have funds to pay larger social medial sites thousands of dollars for a developer account to use their APIs, so we only went back 1 calendar year, to not scrape too much of their data. We wanted to respect their data collection, while still being able to enjoy the challenge of a good ol' Hackathon.*

*We also batched the requests to not overload any services... we're nice like that. Plus, we are only talking about > 100 mbs of data, so it's not like we are scraping the entire internet.* 😉
